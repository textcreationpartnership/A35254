            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THat Tract of Land called <hi>Guinea,</hi> comprehends ſeven hundred Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from <hi>Cap Verd</hi> in fourteen Degrees of North Latitude, and nineteen of Eaſt Longitude to Cape <hi>Gonſalvo</hi> in the firſt Degree of Southern Latitude, and thirty of Eaſt Longitude; The <hi>Portugals</hi> were the firſt that ranged this Shore, and having ſome Intelligence of their Commodities, and the manner of Trading with them; by fair means and force together, they got footing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea coaſts, building Forts in ſome, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44690:4"/>placing Garriſons and Factories in other places, which they then found ſuch a Golden Trade, that they called ſome Coaſts thereof by that name, and perceiving it ſo beneficial to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Countrey, it was an induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as what will not Gold attract) to their further ſearch on theſe Maritine Coaſts all along to the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and thereby conſequently to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> The fair quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and courteous uſage, which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants received from the <hi>Portugals</hi> already ſetled there, incouraged them to exchange their Commodities with them, which Trade accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cuſtom of that Kingdom was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Factors, upon the King of <hi>Portugals</hi> particular account in every Port and Town, as if he intended the profits of Merchandizing ſhould defray the charges of his Conqueſts and Garriſons, furniſhing the Natives with Salt, Iron, Tin, Copper, Baſons, Knives, Cloth, Linnen, and other <hi>European</hi> Goods, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in exchange, partly Cattle, Corn, Rice, and the like, but chiefly Gold it ſelf in great abundance, both in Sand and melted Ingots, which gave Life and Briskneſs to the further Diſcovery of thoſe Countreys, and continuance of that Trade to this very day, though not ſo conſiderable as formerly.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and other Nations, deſirous to ſhare in this Rich Trade, in ſhort time Sailed thither, and becauſe they had no Forts to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44690:4"/>their Perſons and Goods from the danger of the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and treachery of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, they were compelled to Anchor along the Coaſts near the greateſt Towns of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and ſignifying to the <hi>Negroes</hi> what Wares they had brought, by their plauſible demeanor, they at length imboldened them to come aboard their Ships, and bring their Gold, the manner of which Trade was very different from that of any other Countrey; For be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44690:5"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom they found to have a better Trade than themſelves, they ſecretly bribed thoſe Factors aforementioned to carry their Paſſengers and Merchants aboard their own Ships, and not the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> obliging them to Trade only with the <hi>Dutch;</hi> Which Craft the <hi>Engliſh</hi> perceiving, uſed the ſame Arts to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Factors to themſelves, ſo that out-try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other, theſe Brokers commonly gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to themſelves ſix or ſeven <hi>per Cent.</hi> to the vaſt prejudice of all Trade upon theſe Coaſts, for the future, ſince this ill Cuſtom muſt be kept up by all Succeeding <hi>European</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;</p>
               <p>It was obſerved that many <hi>Negro</hi> Merchants who dwelt up in the Countrey coming to buy Wares of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> with great quantities of Gold, and divers Slaves, thirty or more accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Quality, to carry back the Goods they ſhould purchaſe, and taking their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Houſes of theſe Brokers, whom they acquainted with their full Commiſſions and Intentions, and to whom they delivered their Gold, theſe Factors would go aboard the <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Ships with them to Trade and Barter, and if the <hi>Negro</hi> Merchants were not skilled in the <hi>Portugal</hi> Tongue, theſe Brokers would bid the <hi>Hollanders</hi> not to ſpeak the <hi>Moriſco</hi> Language to them, becauſe they Inhabited far within the Land, thereby giving the <hi>Dutch</hi> the watch-word, that they meant to deceive
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44690:5"/>their Countreymen, and afterward divide the Spoil, ſo that the knaviſh Factor connived at the extravagant prizes of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to draw the more Gold from the Merchant, whom he likewiſe cheated, ſometimes by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome of his Gold into his Mouth, Ears, or otherwiſe, which the Merchant <hi>Negro</hi> finding wanting in the Scale, adds to the Cheat him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by blowing into the Chriſtians Ballance to make it weight; The bargain being finiſhed, and the <hi>Negro</hi> again landed, the Factor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns back to the Ship, to ſhare his ill got gains with the <hi>Flemings;</hi> This way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was very detrimental to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and other Chriſtians that Trade upon theſe Coaſts, ſo that unleſs they likewiſe connive with theſe Factors, their Voyage will be loſt, and their Commodities unſold.</p>
               <p>In 1553. <hi>Thomas Windam,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Pintado</hi> a <hi>Portugal,</hi> in two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded along theſe Coaſts as far as <hi>Benin,</hi> where they preſented themſelves to the King who ſate in a great Hall, the Walls whereof were made of Earth without Windows, the Roof of thin Boards, open in divers places; his Nobles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look him in the Face, but ſit with their Buttocks on the ground, and their hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Faces, not looking up till the King commands them; when they depart they go backward, turning their Faces ſtill toward him. The next year Captain <hi>John Lock</hi> Sailed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44690:6"/>into theſe Parts to Trade for Gold and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants Teeth; And after him Captain <hi>Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> made ſeveral Voyages thither, who at the River St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> obſerved a kind of Peaſe growing on the Shore like Trees, with ſtalks twenty ſeven paces long; At Cape <hi>Tres Puntas,</hi> they made him Swear by the Water of the Sea, that he would not hurt them, before they would Trade with him; <hi>Aban</hi> a <hi>Negro</hi> King treated them kindly with a Pot of Palm or Coco-Wine, which they draw out of Trees.</p>
               <p>The People are handſom and well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, having nothing diſagreeable in their Countenances, but the blackneſs of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, ſome of them have flattiſh Noſes, all little Ears, my <hi>Dutch</hi> Author who writ ſome years ſince relates, that the People go all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked till they are married, and then are cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the middle to the knees; At the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of their Daughters, they give half an Ounce of Gold to buy Wine for the Wedding, the Bride in the preſence of her Friends ſwears to be true to her Husband, which the man doth not, for they have as many Wives as they can maintain, yet the firſt has this preheminence, that he can never take another but by her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but becauſe the multitude of Wives and Children are counted the greateſt honour and riches in that Countrey, they often perſuade their Husbands to take more, and glory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the firſt Wife likewiſe has the priviledge to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44690:6"/>lye with her Husband three Nights ſucceſſively, whilſt the reſt muſt be content only with one, ſo that they live very quietly together, a Merchant or Captain will have thirty or forty, the King of <hi>Benin</hi> had ſix hundred, wherewith he went in Solemn Proceſſion every year; The King of <hi>Fetu</hi>'s Son had fourteen Sons and twelve Daughters, and kept an hundred Slaves to wait upon them; At <hi>Cape Gonſalvo</hi> they pink and colour their bodies, and offer their Wives to Strangers; The King uſes his own Daughters when grown up as Wives, and the Queens with the like inceſtuous abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination make uſe of their own Sons.</p>
               <p>Their Women (ſaith my Author) are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Diſcoverers of Natures moſt hidden ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, not being aſhamed to be delivered pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly in the ſight of Men, Boys and Girls. They circumciſe both Sexes, after Travel they accompany not their Husbands in three months after; as ſoon as ſhe is delivered they gave her a drink made of Rice, Mays, Water, Wine, and <hi>Mallaguette</hi> like our Pepper, after which ſhe lyes warm three or four hours, and then riſes, waſhes her ſelf and Child, and ſo falls to her work as before; Next they give it a name, uſually of ſome Chriſtian they are obliged to, then wrapping it in a kind of Blanket or Skin, they lay it upon Ruſhes where it continues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five weeks, then the Mother tyes it to a board and carries it on her back with the Legs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44690:7"/>under her arm-pits, and the hands tyed about her neck, where it hangs all day, and never comes off till it goes to bed, and yet few or none of them prove lame or deformed, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the ſhaking of their bodies, they give them the breaſt over their ſhoulders, and this may be the reaſon of the flatneſs of their Noſes by their knocking them continually againſt the Back and Shoulders of the Mother while ſhe is walking or at work; for it is obſerved that the Children of their Gentry whoſe Mothers do not labour, nor carry their Infants about them, have very comely Noſes; they waſh and rub them every morning with Oil of Palms.</p>
               <p>When they are ſeven or eight years old, they hang a Net about their Necks, made of the Bark of a Tree, full of <hi>Fetiches</hi> or little Gods to ſecure them from the Devil, who they believe would elſe carry them away; They hang their Hair full of Shells, and Coral, about the Arms and Legs, with ſeveral <hi>Feticho's</hi> of different qualities, one being an Antidote againſt Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a ſecond againſt dangerous Falls, a third prevents Bleeding, a fourth cauſes Sleep, a fifth ſecures them againſt Wild Beaſts, and the like, giving to each <hi>Fetiſſo</hi> a different name: They ſoon learn to ſpeak, go, and ſwim: When they are born, they are not black, but red: About ſeven year old they learn them to ſpin Thred, make Nets, and go a Fiſhing with their Fathers, and feed as they do, picking up any naſty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44690:7"/>thing in the Streets, which they eat with good Appetites: The Boys and Girls are all naked together, which makes them have no ſenſe of ſhame or modeſty, they being neither reproved nor corrected by their Parents: They are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent at Swimming, even at this Age, ſo that if their Canoe overſet at Sea, they are very little concerned, all of them ſwimming back again to the place from whence they came, and conſequently they can Dive with great dexterity and fetch up any thing from the bottom: About twelve their Fathers inſtruct them how to make a Canoe, and catch Fiſh; The Merchants bring their Sons acquainted with <hi>Europeans,</hi> and with the Myſtery of Trade: At eighteen they begin to ſet up for themſelves, two or three together hiring a Houſe and purchaſing a Canoe; they then cover their Nudities, grow amorous, and their Fathers look out Wives for them: The Girls clean the Houſes, pick the Rice, beat the Mays, make the Bread, clean the Kitchen, buy and ſell at Market, make Baskets of Ruſhes and Matts which they weave extream curiouſly, but their chief care is to provide Meat and Drink for their Parents, ſecure their Goods, and all other kinds of good Huſwifry; when grown up, they are vary laſcivious, and boaſt of their Gallantries, eſpecially with Strangers, whom they ſeem to affect above their own Men: They are very careful to keep their Teeth white, have Wit enough, but are very wanton
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44690:8"/>with the Young Fellows ſtark naked, to pleaſe whom they waſh, comb, and plait their hair with great curioſity, ſome paint their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads and Eyebrows red and white, and hang Pendants in their Ears, all love Ribbons eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally red, they have Necklaces of Coral, and Bracelets upon their Wriſts, Arms and Legs, when they go abroad they were a piece of Silk, Taffaty or other Stuff wrapt about them from the breaſt to the midleg, and have always a great bunch of Keys, though never a Coffer nor Trunk to open, the Virgins make it their whole buſineſs to appear acceptable eſpecially to white men, and are ſeldom barren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though not very fruitful after Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>For many years the <hi>Engliſh</hi> frequenting theſe Coaſts, made little benefit thereby, for the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants grew ſo ſubtil, that perceiving their Gold was ſo earneſtly deſired by all Nations, they began to know its true value, and ſet ſuch a rate thereon, that having been formerly often beguiled by others, they grew more wary and circumſpect in their bargaining, and to look more narrowly to the meaſure and goodneſs of their Commodities, and though at firſt they knew no diſtinction of Chriſtians, but thought the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and all other white men to be of the ſame Nation, yet they have ſince learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the particular manners and dealing of each Countrey, and have found the faireſt and ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44690:8"/>Trade from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who are therefore moſt welcome to them, and ſpeed beſt of any other Nation whatſoever; Eſpecially ſince his late Majeſties happy Reſtauration, by whoſe gracious favour the Traders into theſe parts were Incorporated, and by their Charter dated <hi>Jan.</hi> 20. 1662. are intituled, <hi>the Company of Royal Adventurers</hi> of <hi>England</hi> Trading into <hi>Africa,</hi> or the <hi>Guinea Company;</hi> The Limits of their Trade, being from <hi>Sally</hi> in South <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary,</hi> to <hi>Cape de bona Eſperanza,</hi> or the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> within which Limits all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships are prohibited to Trade unleſs Authorized by them. The Commodities exported by this Royal Company to <hi>Africa</hi> are Iron, Copper, Sleſias, Sheets, Says, Perpetuana's, Cowries, Welch Plains, Manillos, Boyſades, Chints, Rombergers, Coral, Callico's, Nicanies, Clouts, Amber, Powder, Muskets, Batteries of all forts, Turkey Carpets, Brandy, Strong Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Spirits, Gingharus Taffeties, Beads of all ſorts, Buckſhaws, Knives and Sheaths, Swords, Tallow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For which they import from thence to <hi>England,</hi> Gold, Elephants Teeth, Hides, Malagueta, or Ginny Pepper, Red Wood, Ambergreece, with ſeveral other good Commodities, beſides numbers of <hi>Negroes</hi> for ſupplying his Majeſties <hi>American</hi> Plantations to their great advantage; They have likewiſe divers Forts and Factories eſtabliſhed upon thoſe Coaſts, for the ſecurity and defence of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44690:9"/>their Merchandize and Commerce in <hi>Africa,</hi> for the names of ſome of which I muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to a Gentleman, who has lately travelled thither, of which I ſhall give a brief account, and touch upon the manners of the Natives and other obſervables as I paſs along.</p>
               <p>The firſt place he mentions is <hi>Gambo,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a Fort, with eight pieces of Cannon, and the Government worth about two Thouſand Pound a year; It is Scituate near <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> ſo called from its continual greenneſs, which makes it a moſt delectable place, being a Promontory, which throws it ſelf into the Sea, covered with green Trees, and cauſing a very beautiful Proſpect by reaſon of their evenneſs, ſeeming as if planted by a line; we have already deſcribed the Natives, only may add, that they have generally ſmall Bellies, long Legs, broad Feet, long Toes, ſharp Sight, quick Wits, are Envious, curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Neat, Thieves, Letcherous, ſubject to the Pox, of which as well as their <hi>Pudenda</hi> they are not the leaſt aſhamed, yet hold break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wind backward a great incivility, and wondred at the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for offering them ſuch contempt; Laſtly, they have Stomachs like Eſtridges, as appears by their ſtrange and uſual repaſts, of which I ſhall next give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>When they go to Market, they waſh from Head to Foot, and put on other Cloths; They
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44690:9"/>buy only for one day; Their Bread is made by ſtamping their Millet as we do Spice in a woodden diſh, ſteeping it over night with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Maiz, and in the morning laying it on a ſtone, they grind it with another ſtone, as Painters do their Colours, till it be dough, which they then temper with freſh Water and Salt, and make Rolls thereof twice ſo big as a mans Fiſt, baking them a little on the Hearth, and then eat it; Their Viands are raw fleſh, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of Corn, large draughts of <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> Dogs, Catts, Buffles, Elephants, though ſtinking like Carrion, and a thouſand Magots crawling on them; They have little Birds like Bullfinches which hang their Neſts on the ſmall ends of branches of Trees for fear of Snakes, theſe they eat alive Feathers and all; The <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi>'s ſay that up in the Countrey, they eat dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Snakes, and the guts of Dogs raw, which our Author hath ſeen, and a Boy who was left on Ship-board in pawn for Money, would pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately kill the Hens, that he might eat the raw Guts; They likewiſe eat raw ſtinking Fiſh dried in the Sun, yet can diſpence with dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties when they have them; They make a kind of Ale of Mays and Water boyl'd together, and putting it into a Veſſel as large as a Kilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, four or five place themſelves round, and drink it off, each ſending a little Pot full to his beſt beloved Wife; They lay their hands upon the Head of him that drinks, and cry aloud
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44690:10"/>
                  <hi>Tautoſi, Tautoſi;</hi> He muſt not drink off all, but leaves a little to throw on the ground to his <hi>Fetiſſo,</hi> ſaying <hi>I, ou,</hi> ſpouting out ſome on the Arms and Legs of their <hi>Fetiſſo's,</hi> ſuppoſing that otherwiſe they ſhould not drink in quiet; They are great drinkers, and feed as unmannerly as Swine, ſitting on the ground, and cramming it in, not ſwallowing one Morſel after another, but tear their meat to pieces, and throw it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Mouths, which ſtand gaping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, they are always hungry, and would eat all day long; Yea the <hi>Europeans</hi> have great Appetites while they are there; He that gets moſt, drinks moſt of their ſtrong Liquors, for they lay up but little.</p>
               <p>The next place belonging to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on theſe Coaſts is in the River of <hi>Sierra Leona,</hi> where our Author ſays, an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> dwelt a long time in one of the Iſles, having a fair Houſe, guarded with four pieces of Cannon, and was well beloved and protected by the Kings of that Countrey. In the firſt War with <hi>Holland</hi> 1666. our Author being aboard a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man of War, this <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factor writ to them divers times to deſire he might come and Trade with them, they told him he might do it with ſafety, and upon their Parole, the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> called <hi>Abraham</hi> came aboard them in his Shallop, rowed by three Slaves, accompanied by a <hi>Hollander</hi> and two others which belonged to him, and was kindly treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44690:10"/>but afterward the Captain contrary to the advice of the reſt, treacherouſly made him a Priſoner; and the three <hi>Moores</hi> with him, to their great ſurprizal; And <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. 1667. their great Shallop was manned out with thirty Men, and one Piece of Ordnance to Beſiege and plunder his Houſe, which was built of Brick and Freeſtone, defended with four great Guns, incompaſſed with a fair Wood of Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, which ſupplied him with Wine; On one ſide were about twenty Cabines for the Natives, and on the other a Spring of good Water, it being the moſt beautiful Iſland upon the River.</p>
               <p>Being about to land, they diſcovered 200 <hi>Moores</hi> got together about the Houſe with Firelocks, and a greater number farther up in the Woods, which obliged the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to make a ſhow of going up higher, as being weaker, and therefore had more occaſion for the wind, but the <hi>Negroes</hi> thought they had been gone to <hi>Bowre,</hi> and diſpatch a Canoe to give the King of <hi>Boulom</hi> the Alarum, which was perſued by the Enemy, who fired into their Boat, and at length took them, they were two young Slaves belonging to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who lived with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factor, but would confeſs nothing of their Meſſage; The <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Houſe obſerving what paſſed, fired at them with their Cannon, and three of their Bullets fell within ten paces of the Boat; The
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44690:11"/>
                  <hi>Hollanders</hi> put themſelves out of the reach of their Guns for the preſent, and came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to wait the Tyde; About an hour after two <hi>Moores</hi> belonging to one of the Neighbour Iſlands made up directly to them in a Canoe, and came within Piſtol-ſhot, but would not be perſuaded aboard, the <hi>Dutch</hi> firing on them, they fled, and ſtooping for fear of their fire, ſeemed no higher than Catts; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>interim</hi> played upon them, though they ſaw they were out of their reach, to ſhew the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives they had undertaken their Defence, and deſired their Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The Tyde coming in, the <hi>Dutch</hi> retreated to their Ship, wherein they found ſeveral <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> and among them the King of <hi>Bouloms</hi> Son called <hi>Bembo,</hi> about 35 years old, well proportioned, and abating his Blackneſs, a very handſom Man, he was a very great Friend of <hi>Abrahams</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factor, and when he underſtood he was a Priſoner, he inſtantly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceded for his Ranſom, and on <hi>Monday</hi> noon came on board again with an hundred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants Teeth, weighing nine hundred pound weight, and two Civet Catts alive, upon the delivery whereof <hi>Abraham</hi> was diſmiſt, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> giving him a little Barrel of Strong-Waters, a Roll of Tobacco, a Cheeſe and a Salvo of three Guns.</p>
               <p>In the River of <hi>Madre-Bomba</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have likewiſe a Houſe or Factory not inferiour
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44690:11"/>to that of <hi>Siorra-Leone.</hi> The Kingdom of <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom,</hi> wherein it ſeated, is principally inclined to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> of which laſt there are ſeveral that inhabit there. Let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Religion of the <hi>Negro's,</hi> if we may ſo call it, which is generally <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> they greet the New Moon with horrible roarings, and ſtrange geſtures of Adoration; they offer their Sacrifices in the Woods before great hollow Trees wherein their Idols are placed, yet this they do rather out of Cuſtom than Zeal, uſing neither Form nor Method in their Devotions, every one making a God after his own fancy; ſome ſeeming to incline to <hi>Mahumatiſm,</hi> others to <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> and many of them are <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,</hi> yet divers affirm, that God who giveth all things, and can do what he pleaſeth, and cauſes Thunders, Lightning, Rain and Wind, is Omnipotent, and needs neither praying to, nor to be ſet forth in ſo myſterious a way as that of the Trinity. They believe that when People die they go into another World, and will have occaſion for many of the ſame things they uſe here, and therefore put part of their Houſholdſtuff into the Grave with the dead Corps; and if they loſe any thing, imagine their Friends in the other World had need of it, and have taken it away:</p>
               <p>They have no Letters nor Books, yet keep <hi>Tueſday</hi> for a Sabbath, forbearing then their Fiſhing and Husbandry, and the Palm Wine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44690:12"/>which is gotten that day muſt not be ſold, but is offered to the King, who beſtows it on his Courtiers to drink at night. On this Day in the midſt of the Market-place they place a Table on four Pillars about three yards high, whoſe flat cover is made of Straw and Reeds woven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon which they place many Straw Rings called <hi>Fetiſſo's</hi> or Gods, and within them ſet Wheat, Water &amp; Oil for their God whom they imagine devours it; Their Prieſt they call <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſero,</hi> who every Feſtival-day placeth a Seat upon that Table, and ſitting thereon, preacheth to the People, but what his Doctrine is, the <hi>Europeans</hi> cannot underſtand: After this the Women offer him their Infants, whom he ſprinkles with Water, wherein a live Snake ſwims, wherewith he likewiſe beſprinkles the Table, and then uttering certain words very loud, and ſtroking the Children with ſome kind of Colours, as if giving them his Bleſſing; he himſelf drinks of that Water, the People clapping their hands and crying, <hi>I ou, I ou,</hi> and ſo he diſmiſſeth this devout Aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Many wear ſuch Rings next their Bodies, to preſerve them from the miſchiefs their angry God might inflict upon them, in honour of whom they daub themſelves with a kind of Chalky Earth, which is their Morning Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens; At their eating, the firſt bit, and the firſt draught is conſecrated to their <hi>Fetiſſo,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they beſprinkle it: If Fiſhermen have
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44690:12"/>not a good Draught, they preſent a piece of Gold to the Prieſt to reconcile them to their frowning Saint, who with his Wives makes a kind of Proceſſion through the Streets, ſmiting his Breaſt, and clapping his Hands with a mighty noiſe, till he come to the Shore, where they cut down boughs from certain Trees, and hang them on their Necks, playing on a Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brel; Then the Prieſt turns to his Wives, and expoſtulates with them, and throws Wheat and other things into the Sea as an Offering to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe the <hi>Fetiſſo</hi>'s diſpleaſure againſt the Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; When the King Sacrifices to his <hi>Fetiſſo,</hi> he commands the Prieſt or <hi>Fiteſſero</hi> to inquire of a Tree, whereunto he aſcribeth Divinity, what he will demand; The Prieſt comes to the Tree, and in a heap of Aſhes there provided, ſticks the Branch of a Tree, and drinking wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of a Baſon, ſpouts it upon the Branch, and then daubeth his Face with the Aſhes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Devil out of the Tree gives an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Kings queſtions; The Nobility likewiſe adore certain Trees, eſteeming them Oracles, and they report the Devil ſometimes appears to them like a black Dog, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while anſwers them without any viſible appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some worſhip a Bird called <hi>Pittoie,</hi> ſpotted and painted as it were with Stars, and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the voice of a Bull; To hear this Bird low in their Journey, is reckoned a good Omen, they ſaying, their <hi>Fetiſſo</hi> promiſes them good
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44690:13"/>Fortune, and therefore they ſet a Veſſel of Water and Wheat in the place where they hear it; And as the Earth and Air yield them Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſo the Sea is not illiberal to them, but yields certain Fiſhes whom they Canonize, upon this account, they never take the <hi>Tunny</hi> Fiſh, the <hi>Swordfiſh</hi> they take and eat, but dry the Sword on his back, which is held in great Veneration: Yea the Mountains are not without honour, and if they did not pacifie their Anger by ſetting daily Preſents of Meat and Drink thereon, they believe they would bend their ſullen Brows, and as their High Tops threaten to ſcale Heaven, would overwhelm the Earth, and deſtroy them all.</p>

               <p>In the mean time, the deareſt of his Wives fills all the Houſe with Mourning, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Friends aſſiſting with Songs and Dances; At length they take up the Corps and carry it to the Grave, which is about four foot deep, and covered with Stakes that nothing may fall therein; The Women come about the Sepulchre, and expoſtulate thus with him in a pitiful and lamenting voice, <hi>Alas, why didſt thou dye? Thou hadſt ſo much Wheat, ſo much Maiz, thou waſt beloved of thy Family, and they had great care of thy Perſon, why there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wouldſt thou dye? what have we deſerved, wherein have we offended thee, what diſcontent have we ever given thee, to oblige thee to leave us?</hi> If he be a man, they add; <hi>Thou wert ſo valiant, ſo generous, thou haſt overthrown ſo many Enemies; thou haſt behaved thy ſelf gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly in ſo many Fights, who ſhall now defend us from our Adverſaries? Wherefore then wouldſt thou dye?</hi> Others cry, <hi>He is dead, that brave Huntſman, that excellent Fiſherman, that vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Warriour, that great deſtroyer of</hi> Portugals,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44690:15"/>
                  <hi>that generous Defender of our Gountrey, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this World.</hi> Then they throw on a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Earth, but none can get in to the Corps, for he hath with him his Houſhold Stuff, Armour, and whatſoever he uſed in his life time, and Wine too, if he loved it, to drink in the other World. Laſtly, they cover the Sepulchre with a Roof to defend all from Rain; If the King dyes, greater Solemnity is uſed, yea his No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles thinking ſo great a Perſonage ought to have Attendants, one offers to him a Servant, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Wife, a third his Son or Daughter, even many of both Sexes to wait upon him, all whom are ſuddenly ſlain, and their Bloody Carcaſſes buried with him, yea the Kings Wives who loved him beſt, refuſe not this laſt and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Service, but are willing to dye, that they may again live with him. The Heads of the Slain are ſet upon Poles round about the Sepulchre; Meat, Drink, Cloths, Arms, and other Utenſils are buried with them; After the Funeral, they go to the Sea, and there uſe other Ceremonies, ſome waſhing, while others play on Baſons and Inſtruments, where the Widdow or Widdower is laid backward on the water with divers words of complaint, at laſt they return back to the dead Mans Houſe, where they are very merry, drinking themſelves drunk, and waſhing away all further ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Near Cape <hi>Miſerado,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ware houſe or Factory, being in great
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44690:16"/>favour with the Natives, who have no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for any other Nation that are Enemies to them; It was called <hi>Miſerado</hi> by the <hi>Portugals,</hi> either becauſe it is incompaſſed with Rocks that lye under water, and would inevitably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy any Veſſel which ſhould come nearer than half a League, or becauſe the <hi>French</hi> who were formerly Maſſacred here, cryed out <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricorde, Miſericorde, Mercy, Mercy;</hi> Beſides the Natives of this place being very cruel, they have denominated the River, and called it <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> as being <hi>hard and fatal</hi> to the <hi>Europeans.</hi> The Government of this Countrey is abſolute and unlimited Monarchy, ſo that the King is the only and ſole Judge in all Cauſes, and though he admit his Councellors ſometimes to give their Opinions, yet he follows his own ſingle reſolved determinations; This abſolute Power makes him jealous of his Honour, of which he will not endure the leaſt diminution; His Higheſt Pomp conſiſts in ſitting upon a Shield, whereby he ſignifies that he is the Protection and Defence of his Countrey, and the Manager of all Wars, pacifying Civil Inſurrections, and other weighty matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him alone; His Title is <hi>Dondagh,</hi> which is as much as <hi>Monarch.</hi> When any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman is Diſobedient, and will not appear upon Summons, he ſends this <hi>Koredo</hi> or Shield, as if he would upbraidingly ſay, <hi>Be you Lord your ſelf, and bear the burden of the Countrey.</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44690:16"/>This peremptory command by the Shield is ſent by two Drummers, who as ſoon as they come near the Offenders Habitation, begin to beat their Drums, and ſo continue without ceaſing till they have delivered the Shield, upon receipt whereof, he muſt ſpeed away to Court without delay, carrying the Shield with him, which he preſents to the King, begging forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for his miſcarriages, and ſo taking up the Earth before the King, humbles himſelf.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that Addreſs to the King for any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, make their way with Preſents of Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bons, Elephants Teeth, or ſuch things, which he muſt deliver at the Houſe of the Kings chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Wife, who carries it to the King, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Perſon may be admitted into his preſence; If the King accept it, the Perſon hath leave to enter, otherwiſe if any complaints be brought againſt him, he ſends it back, yet ſo as the Preſenter dares not receive and carry it away, but continues his Suit by Friends with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, by whoſe frequent and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mediations, the King at laſt ſeeming a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pacified, remits his ſeverity, takes the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and calls for the Suppliant, who entring the Royal Preſence, goes bowing all along to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the King, who ſits on the ground upon a Mat, leaning on a Stool, when he approaches within two ſteps, he bows himſelf to the Earth, kneeling down upon one Knee with his his right Elbow on the ground, and names

If it be a Perſon of Quality and his Subject, the King perhaps cauſes a Mat to be ſpread on the ground, upon which ſitting at ſome diſtance, he moves his requeſt; But if a Forreigner, who comes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſalute the King, he is conducted to him without any further Ceremony, and receives an immediate diſpatch; If the Perſon have any Propoſition, Petition, or Complaint to make, an Interpreter is called, who coming with his Bow in his hand, opens the whole matter to the King, ſentence by ſentence, where to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the quality of the Affair he receives Anſwer, with promiſe, if upon complaint, that when he hath heard the other party, he will forthwith give Judgment according to Right.</p>
               <p>If any man come to thank the King for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exemplary Juſtice in a difficult Cauſe, after his Preſents received, he diveſts himſelf of all his Cloths and Ornaments, ſaving a little Cloth to cover his Virilities, and ſo caſts himſelf back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon the groudn, and inſtantly turning again, riſes upon one knee, takes up Earth with his hand, and lays it upon his head, then lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with one Elbow upon the Earth, he ſays three times <hi>Dondagh,</hi> whereupon the King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers ſometimes <hi>Namady, I thank you,</hi> and ſometimes otherwiſe as he thinks fit: The firſt Addreſs is uſually performed in his own Houſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44690:17"/>in the preſence of his chiefeſt Wife, but ſuch as concern Juſtice, or the State of the Countrey he hears in the Council Houſe in the preſence of his Lords. When ſome Eminent Perſon ſent from a Neighbour King, deſires Audience, one of the Kings Wives goes with a Preſent, and tells him who ſent it, whereupon the Perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears before the King and takes up Earth.</p>
               <p>When an Ambaſſador ſent from another Great Prince approaches the Borders, he gives notice of his coming, whereupon he is ordered to remain in the next Town till all be made ready which is requiſite in the Kings Town; There he is received with great Triumphs, which conſiſt in exerciſing with Bows, Arrows, Lances and Shields, as if they were fighting againſt Enemies, with great Drummings and Songs of War; The Sport ended, the King retires to the Council-Houſe, where after a little ſtay, inquiry is made if the King may be ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; whereupon having permiſſion, the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador enters, and kneeling down with his back to the King, and his Bow in his hand bent to the utmoſt, he alluſively implys, that he will ſet himſelf to the utmoſt againſt his Enemies: Mean time the Ambaſſadors follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers chant forth his praiſes, as before the Kings Servants ſung Elogiums to his Honour: Theſe Encomiums they always begin with <hi>Polo, Polo Sammach,</hi> and then add, <hi>His handy-work is not to be equalled by another man,</hi> and then, <hi>I
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44690:18"/>will ſtick as cloſe as Pitch to him that oppoſes me.</hi> The Council-Houſe is open on all ſides, with great Attendance round about, where he receives this firſt Addreſs; After which the Ambaſſador deſires leave to relate his Embaſſy, but is put off till next day, ſo retiring, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts himſelf till the appointed time in Feaſts and Sportive Recreations. The Ambaſſador receives Anſwer by the Kings directions from an Interpreter, and then is ſhewed the Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him and his Retinue, where the Kings Slaves bring them Water to waſh, and the Kings Women being very neatly dreſt, in Diſhes ſet on their heads bring Rice and Fleſh, after which the King ſends for his Welcom, Wine and other Preſents, as a Kettle, Baſon or the like. If any <hi>European</hi> Merchant bring the King a Preſent, he is invited to eat with him, but with no <hi>Black</hi> of what Quality ſoever will he eat out of the ſame Diſh, but ſends their Meat to them by his Women.</p>
               <p>Once a year he makes a Great Feaſt for the Common People, buying up for that purpoſe all the Palm Wine, and Herds of Cattel, the Heads of which are painted and hung up in the Kings Chamber, in teſtimony of his Bounty: He inviteth alſo his Neighbour Kings, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rains and Gentlemen, and then prays and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to his <hi>Fetiſſo,</hi> which is the higheſt Tree in the Town. The King comes little abroad, morning and evening, his Slaves blow Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44690:18"/>made of Elephanſts Teeth while his Wives anoint and waſh his Body: He ſits in ſtate holding in his hand the Tail of an Horſe to drive away Flyes, being gallantly adorned with Rings of Gold on his Arms, Neck and Leggs, and Coral Beads where with he ſets off his Beard. The Kings Children muſt maintain themſelves when of Age, the People not liking to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them idle; the King only beſtows on them a Marriage-Gift and a Slave; when he dies, his eldeſt Brother ſucceeds in the Throne, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys his Rice, Fields, Slaves and Women. Theſe People believe that the Almighty whom they call <hi>Kanuo,</hi> will puniſh all their miſdeeds, and reward well-doers, and therefore when oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, call for his Aid to do them Juſtice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually inculcating. <hi>That there ſhall a time come when all ill men ſhall receive their deſerts.</hi> They imagin that their Friends after death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spirits, whom they call <hi>Jannanen,</hi> and know all Tranſactions here below, with whom therefore they hold familiar Colloquies, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with all their troubles and adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; When they go into the Woods to hunt Elephants, Buffles, or any other dangerous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, they go firſt and offer to the Spirit of their deceaſed Parents, either a Cow, Wine or Rice, which they leave on the Grave; They ſuppoſe them to reſide in the Woods, to whom therefore they addreſs themſelves with great complaints and lamentations when in affliction;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44690:19"/>where likewiſe there moſt Solemn Acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion are performed, when no Women nor Children are permited to come; The King calls upon the Souls of his Father and Mother almoſt in every matter of difficulty.</p>
               <p>If a Woman be ſuſpected of Adultery, the complaining Husband deſires his Wife may be delivered up to <hi>Jannanen,</hi> or the Spirits of his Anceſtors, and brings her in the Evening before the Council Aſſembled to that purpoſe, where after there calling the Spirits to her, ſhe is blindfolded, admoniſhed to forſake her evil Life, and not to go to any but her own Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and proſently a great noiſe or murmur is raiſed, as if Spirits did appear, with ſome unintelligible (though articulate) ſounds, which are interpreted abloud to the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, with threathings, that if ever ſhe commit the like offence again, ſhe ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to her demerits, and together with her Paramour, ſhall be carried away by <hi>Jannanen,</hi> to whom yet none are delivered up but upon clear evidence of their Guilt, to which end they have a Water of Curſing or Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherewith they extort the Truth in all doubtful matters, compounded of Barks and Herbs boiled together, which when it is enough, the Prieſt repeats ſecretly the names of the ſuſpected perſons, or other matters to which the Witchcraft muſt be applied, and then waſhes the Legs and Arms of thoſe accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44690:19"/>with fair Water, after this he puts his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vining Staff, which is bruiſed and tufted at the end, into the Pot, and drops or preſſeth the Water out of it upon the Arm of Leg of the ſuſpected Perſon, muttering theſe words over it, <hi>If he be guilty of this or that, then let this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſcald or burn him till the very Skin come off.</hi> If the Party remain unhurt, they judge him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and proceed to the Trial of another till they have diſcovered the Criminal, who being found, the Executioner inſtantly leads him bound and blindfold into an open Field or Wood, and placing him on his Knees with his Head bowed down, he firſt runs him through the Body with a Scimetar, and then chops off his Head with an Ax, for they do not believe he is dead till his Head is off; The Carcaſe cut into four quarters after great lamentations, they leave in the Feild as a Prey to the Beaſts and Fowls, but the Friends take away the Head as a great Preſent, and boiling it in a Kettle, drink up the Broth, hanging the Scull by their <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſo</hi> or Idol. The like Trial is alſo made of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offences among the <hi>Blacks,</hi> ſo that every one had need be very careful to prevent ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</p>
               <p>Some years ſince <hi>Mendino</hi> the King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou</hi> died, whoſe Subjects and Favourites made ſtrict inquiry according to Cuſtom, how he came by his end, but the narroweſt of their ſerutinies not being able to make any diſcovery,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44690:20"/>they were forced to acquieſce, yet had ſuch an inveterate hatred againſt <hi>Manimaſſah,</hi> Brother of the deceaſed <hi>Mendino,</hi> that they forced him to the Trial, which ſeeing no other Remedy, he underwent without any hurt, as a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſign of his Innocence, whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be reſtored to his former Honour and Credit, but inſtead thereof, the Tryers told him, <hi>The King in his Life time was our Common Father, and ſhould not we after his death endeavour to find out what did befal him, or cauſed him to dye it were a great ſhame for us, we have examined and tryed you, but it ſhall not remain ſo, we will look farther into the buſineſs, and make the Southſayers acquainted with it; Manimaſſah</hi> mad at theſe inhumane uſages, burſt forth at laſt into theſe words; <hi>This ſhame is not to be ſuffered from my own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in my own Countrey, I will go under the Conduct of the Spirits of my deceaſed Friends, and ſeek a dwelling place.</hi> In this manner leaving his Native Countrey, he travelled Northward into <hi>Gala,</hi> inhabited by a mean and ſimple People, and won ſo upon them by his endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behaviour, that they unanimouſly beſought him to be their Prince, to which he conſented upon condition, <hi>That they ſhould give him ſome of their Plants and Veniſon for an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their ſubjection.</hi> This they yeild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, but ſuch was their brutiſh Barbariſm, that though they owned him their Lord, they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44690:20"/>uſed him as their Companion, for being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with Civility, when any of them brought him Wine, Rice or Fleſh, they came again to him to require their Callibaſhes or Baſquets, which unmannerly clowniſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, <hi>Manimaſſah</hi> ſo reſented, that he withdrew from them, to require aſſiſtance from <hi>Flanſire</hi> King of <hi>Folgia,</hi> whoſe Daughter he had Married to reduce the <hi>Gala</hi>'s to his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>The King hearing the requeſt of his Son in Law, lent him many Souldiers under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Flonikerry</hi> his General, who unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly fell into <hi>Gala,</hi> and ſubdued the People, ſetling <hi>Manimaſſah</hi> in an abſolute Dominion, who hath ever ſince continned their Prince, and taught them with ſorrow more reſpective qualities; after this, <hi>Flonikerry</hi> returned to <hi>Folgia,</hi> where he was received and welcomed with great applauſe, and the King willing to gratifie him for his honeſt performances, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Flonikerrys</hi> Petition, gave him leave to go and Conquer, and ſettle himſelf and his People in <hi>Cabo Monte</hi> an adjacent Countrey, expreſſing his kindneſs in ſaying, <hi>I ſhall do the deſire of his Heart,</hi> and ſending a conſiderable force to help him, that he might not be repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; Marching toward this place, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants being numerous and couragious, were not ſoon ſubdued, but at length tired with the continual onſets of their Enemies, who ſhot
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44690:21"/>poyſoned Arrows; which made all wounds though never ſo ſlight prove Mortal, a fatal Invention unknown to theſe People, they went with their Hoods upon their Heads as uſual, to ask favour, which <hi>Flonikerry</hi> natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to pity, eaſily granted, bidding them go lie down with their Faces upon the ground according to the manner of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in ſuch caſes, then coming out of his Fort he trod upon them with his Feet; He then made an agreement with them, which was confirmed as followeth, firſt ſome Hens were killed in the preſence of them all, of whoſe Blood the Conquered ſwallowed a little, as a token of Friendſhip. Afterward the Hens were boiled, and the Fleſh eaten among them, only the Legs were kept for a perpetual Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, for if any Man after that time tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed or broke his promiſe, to him were the Legs ſhown, who upon ſight thereof ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted for fear of the puniſhment that would aſſuredly follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Flonikerry</hi> overjoyed at his ſucceſs, gave free ſcope to his thoughts to range farther, but for aſſuring his new Dominion, he firſt ſought to win the minds of the vanquiſhed to him, and then to contract a firm League of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and correſpondence with the Lords of his own Countrey. But wavering Fortune who minds nothing leſs than contribuance of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, will blemiſh his new gotten glory with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44690:21"/>a dire and unexpected miſhap, for ſcarce were the minds of the Nobility united, when there came out of <hi>Gala, Miminique</hi> Son of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Manimaſſah,</hi> with a great Army of <hi>Gala</hi>'s, and others make War upon him, of whoſe deſign his Father was not ignorant, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already forgot the kindneſs received from <hi>Flonikerrys</hi> Arms in ſetling him in his new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Dominions; <hi>Flonikerry</hi> upon the firſt Intelligence drew together his Forces, to whom the Nobles joining theirs, he formed a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Army, wherewith marching toward the Enemy, they ſoon met and came to a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, wherein by the multitude of their Enemies, they were at firſt put to a diſorderly retreat, which <hi>Flonikerry</hi> who was of an undaunted Spirit perceiving, and not uſed to ſhrink in Fight, digged with his hand a hole in the ground, and put his Knees in it, with a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either to die there, or to remain Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and indeed in one he had his deſire, for after a long and ſharp conteſt at length being even covered with Arrows, he was ſlain on the ſpot. However his men gathering new courage to revenge their Princes death, rallied and gave a freſh charge with ſuch fury, that they turned the Fortune of the day, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſole Maſters of the Field.</p>
               <p>The death of <hi>Flonikerry,</hi> whoſe body they privately buried, was ſometime kept ſecret till they ſent for his Brother <hi>Zillimanque</hi> to take
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44690:22"/>his charge, who immediately accepting the ſame, purſued the Victory, and drew near the Enemies Camp, which he ſoon ſurprized, and gave as a ſpoil to his Souldiers; After which he marched farther, the People all along yielding ſubjection without blows, whereby they ſoon became Maſters of the whole Countrey, and gain'd the reputation of a Mighty People; Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he was poiſoned, as was thought, leaving behind him ſeveral Sons who were young, and not capable to manage their Fathers Conqueſts. However, <hi>Flanſire</hi> his eldeſt was admitted Succeſſor, during whoſe Minority his Uncle <hi>Jemmah</hi> undertook the Government, but <hi>Flanſire</hi> growing to years, took the Royal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority into his own hands, and to ſhew that he inherited as well his Fathers Valour as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, reſolves to inlarge his bounds yet farther, and to that end marcht with his Forces over the River <hi>Galinas</hi> or <hi>Hens,</hi> taking all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent places as far as <hi>Sierra Liona,</hi> and placing Garriſons therein: Having ſettled his new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, he return'd to his own Native Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, where he ſpent a good part of his Life in peace and quietneſs, when on a ſudden there came News from <hi>Sierra Liona</hi> that <hi>Kandaqualla</hi> his Governour was driven out thence, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to fly with all his People to the Iſlands of <hi>Bananeo,</hi> not being able to withſtand, <hi>Falma</hi> of <hi>Dogo,</hi> who with a mighty Force inveded them; <hi>Flanſire</hi> ſtartled at this intelligence, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44690:22"/>knowing nothing more neceſſary than expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſent to the Lords, his Subſtitutes, to raiſe an Army and meet him at an appointed Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouz; but they having made a private Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with <hi>Gamina</hi> their Maſter <hi>Flanſires</hi> Brother, by his inſtigation they neglected and ſlighted his Commands. <hi>Flanſire,</hi> ignorant of this Combination, leaving the Government of his Kingdom, Wives and Children to his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Brother <hi>Gamina,</hi> marched with his eldeſt Son <hi>Flambore</hi> the preſent King of <hi>Quoia,</hi> not doubting in the leaſt the Fidelity of his Provincials: He went firſt by Land to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Hens,</hi> and from thence in Canoes to the Iſles of <hi>Bananes,</hi> to take with him his People who were driven from <hi>Sierra Liona,</hi> and ſo bringing them back thither, he began a ſharp War with <hi>Falma.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Falma</hi> had been formerly in great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the King of <hi>Dogo,</hi> or <hi>Hondo,</hi> but having debauched one of his Wives, the King was thereat ſo much offended, that not content the offence ſhould, as uſual, be bought off with Gifts or Slaves, he cauſed his Ears to be cut off, and baniſhed him his preſence, but length of time ſo wore out the Kings Fury, that <hi>Falma</hi> was again admitted to Court, where he had not been long, but he began to ſhew his Inſolence, and at length addreſt the King in theſe Terms; <hi>Sir King, conſidering the wickedneſs committed againſt you my Lord and Maſter, I am obliged
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44690:23"/>to thank you for your gracious Sentence by which I am puniſhed, whereby every one that looks upon me derides and ſcorns me, and the rather becauſe the puniſhment is unuſual, and the like offence cuſtomarily bought off with Goods and Slaves: Now as you were pleaſed to puniſh me, ſo I deſire the like offence in others may be puniſhed in the ſame manner. It may happen that ſome of the Kings Servants or Subjects may fall into the ſame Lapſe, but if this Sentence be either denied, or not performed, I ſhall complain againſt my Lord the King in the Ways and in the Woods to the Jananen and Belli,</hi> that is, to all the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Demons. The King having heard this audacious Speech, took counſel upon it, and notwithſtanding this ſeeming Threat, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the puniſhment inflicted on him ſhould not follow upon all: But yet to pacifie him in ſome meaſure, he made him General of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to recover <hi>Sierra Liona</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Kandaqualla,</hi> who preſided there for <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To repel this Invader <hi>Flanſire</hi> as we ſaid coming to <hi>Sierra Liona</hi> with an Army, and making ſharp War, at length by the help of ſome <hi>Europeans</hi> he fell upon the Town of <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maha,</hi> and with Axes cutting down the Tree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, at laſt they forced an entrance, and ſet the Houſes on fire, whoſe fury ſoon increaſed to an impoſſibility of being quenched, whereupon <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> unable to reſiſt, fled, whom young <hi>Flam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44690:23"/>purſued, and though he miſt him, yet got great Reputation, the People ſtiling him, <hi>The Purſuen of</hi> Falma. <hi>Flanſire</hi> having thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered theſe Countries, and ſettled <hi>Kanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualla</hi> in his Lieutenantſhip, retreated with his Forces, intending to return to his Wife and Children; But on the way he had notice, that his Brother <hi>Gamana</hi> had uſurped his Kingdom, killed all his Sons he could meet with, taken his Wives for himſelf, and had ſet up his Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at a convenient place near the <hi>River of Hens,</hi> to intercept and hinder his Brothers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; and as commonly one Trouble falls in the neck of another, this Rebellion of his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was attended with the Invaſion of <hi>Monou,</hi> who dwelt near <hi>Cape Miſerado,</hi> and fell into his Countrey at <hi>Cape de Monto,</hi> where they burnt the Town, and led away all they met with for Slaves. <hi>Flanſire</hi> underſtanding theſe miſchiefs, marched toward the River <hi>Maqual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi> with all ſpeedy, but complaining to the <hi>Kanou</hi> and <hi>Jananies</hi> (that is, to God and the Angels) of his diſtreſs in theſe words, <hi>To you only it is known, that my Father left me rightful Heir to his Kingdom, which falls to me by the Laws of the Land, ſeeing I was the eldeſt: You likewiſe know that my Brother hath rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againſt me, and hath ſet himſelf up to be Lord, be you Judges between him and me in this intended Fight, and if the Cauſe be unjuſt that he manages againſt me, let the miſchief fall upon his own head.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44690:24"/>
               <p>Thereupon he paſſed with all his Souldiers over the River, where the Armies ſuddenly met, and his Brother with great numbers of men being ſlain, he obtained a compleat Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, but ſtill kept the Field, though no other oppoſition appeared againſt him. While the King incamped in the Field to be more ready againſt any other appearing Rebels, his Son <hi>Flambore</hi> went with a Squadron of Souldiers into the Woods to hunt Civit Cats, and being by his ſports got far into them, they diſcovered ſome of the Rebels buſie in burying the dead body of <hi>Gamana</hi> the Uſurper, who perceiving <hi>Flambore</hi> and his Followers, immediately fled, imagining he had come purpoſely with thoſe Forces to ſearch them out, and left the Corps behind them, with three Slaves in Chains, whom they intended to have diſpatcht at his Grave according to Cuſtom: Being by this means aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of <hi>Gamana</hi>'s death, when they leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, they brought the three Slaves to <hi>Flanſire,</hi> who having from them underſtood all Circumſtances, and how all things ſtood in the Countrey, he ſent them to their Fellow-Rebels to admoniſh them to come and ask his pardon; and to aſcertain them he would utterly forget their miſdeeds; which goodneſs of the Kings, though preſented by the mouth of theſe Slaves, wrought the deſired Effect, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels immediately ſubmitted, and received their Pardon. This Rebellion thus ſuppreſt, King
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44690:24"/>
                  <hi>Flanſire</hi> with all his Power marched to <hi>Cape Miſerado</hi> to reduce <hi>Monou,</hi> which he did with great ſlaughter and ſpoil of the Countrey, and then retired home with his Forces, till <hi>Monou</hi> made a New Inſurrection to revenge the Loſſes of <hi>Falma,</hi> but in ſhort time he was again in a manner totally ſubdued by <hi>Flanſires</hi> People.</p>
               <p>In the Principality of <hi>Anten</hi> near <hi>Tekorari,</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſome years ſince built a Fort, which in 1664. was attaqued by Sir <hi>Robert Holms</hi> in behalf of the <hi>Royal African</hi> Company, with two of the Kings Men of War, ſix Frigats, and ſome other Ships, and by them with no great difficulty won, but regained the next year by Admiral <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> being at that time only mann'd by four or five in health, and about as many more ſick <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> leaving in it ſeven Iron Guns, and ſix or eight Pounders. Upon the retaking, the Guns being drawn off to the Ship, <hi>De Ruyter</hi> cauſed it, as not being tenable, without many People and great Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to be blown up into the Air, and totally diſmantled with twelve hundred pound of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In the mean time the <hi>Negro</hi>'s of the Mine plundered the Village of <hi>Tekorari,</hi> and laid it waſte with Fire and Sword, out of malice to the <hi>Blacks</hi> of that place, exerciſing great Cruelty upon the Priſoners, cutting off their Heads, wherewith they went dancing and leaping up and down, and at laſt carried them home in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Victory; they were well Armed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Fetu</hi> the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have a Fort called <hi>Cape Corſo,</hi> ſtrengthened with a convenient number of great Guns, and mann'd with a ſtrong Garriſon of Slaves, but in 1664 this with the Forts of <hi>Tekorari</hi> aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Adia,</hi> and <hi>Anemabo</hi> were taken by Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Holmes</hi> for the <hi>Royal African</hi> Company, but when <hi>De Ruyter</hi> in 1665. with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had forced the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fort <hi>Cormantyn,</hi> he ſpared neither diligence nor coſt to regain <hi>Cape Corſe</hi> then in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> poſſeſſion, and the rather becauſe <hi>John Valkenberge</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commander in chief there, judged it very dangerous that any place in that Conntrey ſhould be left in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that if during the Wars in <hi>Europe</hi> they were expelled thence, by conſequence they might eaſily be kept out, whereas by the hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this place, they had an opportunity to ſettle their Juriſdiction in the Countrey again, and in defiance of their Power might defend it againſt them: But finding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſided with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> threatning nothing but Fire and Sword, having alſo poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44690:25"/>of a place, where a hundred men might beat off a thouſand, it was judged not feaſible to be undertaken, without the greateſt danger in the World, and therefore at preſent the deſign was laid aſide.</p>
               <p>In the Kingdom of <hi>Fantyn,</hi> the chief Town upon the Seacoaſts called <hi>Cormantyn</hi> is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal place of Trade, for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſcituate upon a very high Mountain; It is the faireſt and moſt delightful proſpect upon the whole Coaſt, near which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a Caſtle fortified with four Bulwarks. In 1665. <hi>Feb.</hi> 8. This <hi>Cormantyn</hi> was ſurreptitiouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taqued by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the manner thus; The <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet coming to Anchor <hi>Feb.</hi> 6. weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Cormantyn,</hi> the next day they got four or five hundred Canoes with <hi>Negro</hi>'s from the Caſtle <hi>Del Myne,</hi> with which well mann'd they departed from the Fleet, intending to land at <hi>Anemabo,</hi> but were upon their approach near the Shore, ſaluted by the <hi>Negro</hi>'s of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantyn,</hi> who lay behind the clifts and buſhes with Muskets and great Ordnance, playing from the Fort with ſuch fury and violence that they were beaten back, and forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat without doing any thing. This Enterprize was afterward twice reattempted upon hopes of having brought the <hi>Negro</hi>'s to ſide with them, but without ſucceſs, however reſolving not to quit it, they came at laſt to a more ſtrict alliance with the <hi>Negro</hi>'s, who for ſecurity of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44690:26"/>their Faith delivered ſeveral Hoſtages into their hands; and the deſign was to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the firſt opportunity; Having pitcht on a time, at Night a <hi>Negro</hi> called <hi>Antonio,</hi> came in a Canoe ſent by the Inhabitants of <hi>Fantyn,</hi> declaring that the People about <hi>Ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabo,</hi> and <hi>Adja</hi> could not be ready at the appointed hour, but in the Morning they would not fail them of their promiſed aſſiſtance, adding that early in the Morning at the new caſt up Fort of <hi>Adja</hi> the Princes flag ſhould be ſet up, upon which ſign the <hi>Dutch</hi> might land with their whole Force. This concluded, the chief Commanders of the Fleet reſolved the following Morning to make the onſet, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand ſent a Letter to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in chief, requiring the ſurrender of the Fort without oppoſition. Accordingly at eight a Clock in the Morning, the Princes Flag being raiſed upon the new erected Fort of <hi>Adja,</hi> they lanched through with much hazard near the ſame Fort, and marched in order along the Shore with three thouſand <hi>Negro</hi>'s, every one with a Linnen Cloth about his Neck to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from other <hi>Blacks,</hi> and came about Noon to <hi>Anemabo,</hi> drawing forth about a Musket ſhot weſtward of <hi>Cormantyn,</hi> to a Hill planted with three Pieces of Ordnance, where they found ſtout oppoſition, but at length o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verpowered they fled, and then the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> entred the Town, and ſet it on Fire, the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44690:26"/>Flame and Smoke whereof ſuddenly ſurprized the Garriſon in the Caſtle, inſomuch that as ſoon as they ſaw the Souldiers with ſcaling Ladders, hand Granadoes, and other Utenſils of War under their Walls, they took down the red Flag from the Tower, and immediately as it were without a ſtroke delivered it up. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Caſtle were Souldiers out of the Caſtle of <hi>Myne</hi> inſtantly put to ſecure it; To the ſubduing this Fort, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were not a little animated by the promiſe of aſſiſtance from the Natives of <hi>Fantyn,</hi> which they purchaſed of them as we hinted before, for fifty two Bars of Gold, to the value of two thouſand five hundred Pound <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money.</p>
               <p>Half a mile Weſt from <hi>Cormantyn</hi> ſtands <hi>Ane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mabo,</hi> one half whereof is inhabited by the Fiſhermen of the <hi>Myne,</hi> and the other by thoſe of <hi>Fantyn;</hi> At Cannon ſhot diſtance Weſt from this lies <hi>Adja,</hi> where the <hi>Dutch</hi> had a Fort ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in 1664. and by them kept till the attempt upon <hi>Cormantyn,</hi> when they blew it up with Gunpowder by Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem, for having laid an heap of Earth at the <hi>Mine,</hi> they intended when any came thereon with hopes of plunder, to have blown them up by Springing the Mine, but little harm was done, however the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the mean time left the place and retreated to <hi>Cormantyn.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Adja</hi> and <hi>Anemabo</hi> lies a Town called <hi>Janaſia,</hi> where the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have a Fort. The
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44690:27"/>principal places of Trade lying near the Sea, and frequented by the <hi>Whites</hi> are <hi>Cormantyn</hi> and <hi>Ademabo,</hi> the former having been the chief place of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon this Coaſt for ſome years, where they got the beſt ſort of Goods, and enjoyed moſt Friendſhip, for the ſupport whereof, they built that Fort planted with forty two Pieces of Ordnance, and fortified with four Bulwarks. The King keeps his reſidence in the Town of <hi>Fantyn,</hi> and extends his Juriſdiction about ten or twelve Miles round, being able in time of War to bring eight or ten thouſand men into the Field.</p>
               <p>Theſe Countries produce variety of Creatures, and among others Tygers and Leopards, who bear great enmity to each other, though gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the Tyger is the Conquerour, therefore when the Leopard is purſued by the Tyger, he with his Tail wipes out his footſteps that ſo he may not be traced. Some of the Ancients knowing the fierceneſs of the Tyger, attributed to him the command of the Woods, but in theſe Parts, becauſe he hurts no man but only Beaſts, they make the Leopard King of the Forreſt, for which ravening temper they are hunted and killed by all Men, even for their own ſafety. When a Leopard is killed they bring him dead to the Kings Town, there to be cut up and eaten, being flea'd they preſent his Skin and Teeth to the King, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſſembled, eat the Fleſh boil'd as a dainty,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44690:27"/>ſpending the remainder of the day in Revelling and Dancing, as at their moſt Solemn Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals. There is likewiſe a monſtrous Creature which the Portugals call Salvage, that is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, it hath a great head, a heavy body, fleſhy and ſtrong arms, no tail, and goes ſometimes upright, and otherwhile upon all four like an Ape. The <hi>Blacks</hi> affirm it is of Humane Race, but by the alteration and change of the Woods and Wilderneſs it is become half a Beaſt, they ſuſtain themſelves in the Woods with Fruit and wild Honey, which they get out of the Trees, and as they are numerous, ſo upon meeting, they fight continually with each other. The <hi>Negro</hi>'s relate ſtrange things of them, and aver for certain, that they not only overpower fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Women and Virgins, but dare alſo ſet upon armed Men. There is another ſtrange Beaſt, like a Crocodile ſix or ſeven Foot long, very ſlender, and the Tongue of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary length. It is a Beaſt of Prey, and very ſtrong, cloſe ſet with gaudy Quills over the whole body, wherewith it offends Men, and defends it ſelf againſt other Creatures, for when the Leopard attempts to ſeize it, it converts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a round Ball, ſetting up the points of its Quills that no hold can be fixed, their Food is generally Piſmires, which with their Tongues they lick up at a great diſtance.</p>
               <p>Both on the Sea coaſts, and the upland Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey many Civet Cats are found, it more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44690:28"/>a Wolf than a Cat, for it hath a long Head, ſmall Noſe, flat Mouth, and ſhort Ears, Teeth like a Dog, the Body part white, part aſhcolour'd, ſpeckled with black ſpots, the Legs and Feet of a middle ſize, with black Hairs, having four Claws forward and one backward, with black ſhort flat Nails, the Tail long, buſhy and ſpeckled hanging to the ground; The Civet lyes between the Privities and the Cods, and is taken thence with a Spoon or ſome other fit Inſtrument. The Giraffa or Camelo-pard is a Beaſt not often ſeen, yet very tame, ſtrangely compounded of a Libard, Hart, Buffle and Camel, and by reaſon of his long legs before and ſhorter behind, is not able to graze without difficulty, but with his high Head, which he can ſtretch forth half a Pikes length in height, feeds on the leaves and boughs of Trees. The Camels in <hi>Africk</hi> are more hardy than in other places, and will not only carry great burthens, but travel fifty days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without any Corn, only turn them out at night to feed on Thiſtles, Boughs, and the like, and no leſs patient are they of Thirſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to endure fifteen days without Drink. The Lions in cold places are gentler, in hotter more fierce, and will not flie the approach of two hundred Armed Horſemen; in time of their coupling eight or ten will follow one Female, with terrible and bloody Battels among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: They report that Lions ſpare thoſe who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44690:28"/>kneel to them, and prey rather on Men than Women, and not at all on Infants, unleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by hunger. The <hi>Africans</hi> believe he hath underſtanding, and tell of a <hi>Getulian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who lying at the mercy of a Lion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him, that being ſo noble a Beaſt, he would not diſhonour himſelf with ſo ignoble a Prey, as ſhe a weak Woman was, whereupon he went away and left her: His Tail ſeems to be his Scepter, whereby he expreſſeth his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; he ſhrinks at no danger, unleſs the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of the Woods ſhroud him from Witneſſes, and then he will take the benefit of flight, which otherwiſe he ſeems to diſdain. <hi>Mento</hi> a Man of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> was encountred with a Lion, who inſtead of rending, fawned upon him, and with his dumb eloquence, ſeemed to implore his Aid, ſhewing his Foot, wherein <hi>Mentor</hi> perceived a Thorn to ſtick, which he pluckt out. The like is reported by <hi>Gellius</hi> of a Fugitive Servant, who having performed the ſame kind Office to a Lion, was by him gratified for a long time by giving him a daily portion of his Prey: It happened that afterward this Man was taken, and preſented to his Maſter a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, who exhibited Games to the People, wherein Slaves and condemned Perſons were expoſed to the fury of Beaſts, among whom he put this Servant, and by a wonderful fate this Lion was ſoon after taken, and brought to execute theſe horrid Spectacles. The Beaſts running with
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44690:29"/>violence to their bloody Encounter, ſuddenly this Lion ſtayed, and taking a ſtrict view of him, fawned upon this his Gueſt, and defended him from the Aſſaults of the other Beaſts, whereupon at the Peoples Interceſſion, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Paſſages from him, he was freed, and the Lion given him, who followed him with a ſtring through the Streets, the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors crying, <hi>This is the Man who was the Lions Phyſician; This is the Lion who was this Mans Hoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Hyaena</hi> is another ſtrange Beaſt which ſome have thought to be Male one year, and Female another, it hath no Joint in the Neck, and therefore ſtirs not his Head, but the whole Body at once; He is ſaid to imitate the Voice of Men, and drawing near the Sheepfolds, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard the name of ſome of the Shepherds, will call him, and when he comes devour him: They ſay his Eyes are of various Colours, and that his ſhadow prevents the barking of a Dog: By ingendring with this Beaſt, the Lioneſs brings forth a <hi>Corcuta</hi> of like qualities with the <hi>Hyaena,</hi> he hath one continued Tooth without diviſion throughout his Mouth. The <hi>Lybard</hi> is not hurtful to Men except they diſturb him. The <hi>Dabu</hi> is ſaid to be a fooliſh Creature, in ſhape like a Wolf, only his Legs and Feet are like a Mans; they that know his haunts, ſing and fiddle before his Den, his Ears being ſo capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with the Muſick, that he is not aware his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44690:29"/>Legs are captivated with a Rope, whereby he is taken. The <hi>Zebra</hi> of all Creatures for beauty and comelineſs is admirable, reſembling an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently proportion'd Horſe, but not ſo ſwift, all overlaid with curious party-colours, from Head to Tail, they live in great Heards, and when one is ſhot, the reſt ſtand ſtill, gazing till they ſee three or four fall down before them.</p>
               <p>The Rivers breed Water-Elephants, about the bigneſs of a large Horſe, but much thicker and rounder, ſeeming as if they were blown up; Likewiſe Sea-Cats, and many other monſtrous Creatures. There are variety of Fowls of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds, as Eagles, Parrots, Cranes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more, and among others a Bird no bigger than a Thruſh, by whoſe chirping they gueſs at their good or ill Fortune in their Journey. <hi>Crocodiles</hi> are here ſo large, that they will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an Ox whole; but above all things the monſtrous Serpents produced in theſe Countreys are remarkable, among which the moſt poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are of a Graſs green: Some are ſo curiouſly ſpotted with lively Colours as are ſcarce to be found in any other Creatures. The King of <hi>Bena,</hi> whom the Inhabitants call <hi>King of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> keeps commonly one of them in his Arms, which he ſtrokes and foſters as it were a young Child, and ſo highly eſteems, that none dare hurt or kill it. The <hi>Negro's</hi> roſt and eat ſome of them as great Dainties. <hi>Africa</hi> hath been famous in all Ages for prodigious Serpents
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44690:30"/>and Monſters. One called <hi>Minia</hi> attains ſuch largeneſs, that it can ſwallow a whole Deer without chewing or tearing to pieces, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Boars and many other Beaſts and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; It lurks for Prey within ſome buſh, which coming within reach, it ſuddenly ſeizes, wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two or three times about the body and loins, till it falls down and dies, of which thus glutted he lies, not able to ſtir till his gorged Paunch has digeſted his Meal: Of this kind was that which the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians mention, which <hi>Attilius Regulus</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſul in the firſt <hi>Punick</hi> War at the River <hi>Bagrada</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred, and planted his Engines and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery againſt it, whoſe Skin ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> for a Monument, was in length an hundred and twenty Foot: The Scales defended it from all hurt by Darts or Arrows, and with the Breath it killed many, and had eat divers of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, till at laſt with a Stone out of an Engine this Deſtroyer was deſtroyed. Hear how the elegant <hi>Lucan,</hi> as eloquently tranſlated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes it, when <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in purſuit of <hi>Cato</hi> into <hi>Africa</hi> came to the place which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the habitation of this dreadful Serpent, and had this account given him by an <hi>African.</hi>

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44690:35"/>
                  <hi>Croſs-River</hi> into <hi>Pirats-Iſland;</hi> after they had taken in their <hi>Negro</hi>'s, and were ready to Sail, the Maſter called up the Boatſwain and three Men more commanding them to look out the Copper Bars that were left, and carry them on Shore to try if they could ſell them; The Boatſwain with his ſmall Company deſired they might have Arms with them, not believing they were ſo harmleſs a People as reported, they took with them three Muſquets and a Piſtol, and ſo rowed toward the Shore, but not far from it their Match unhappily fell into the Water, and the Ship being fallen down lower toward the Sea quite out of ſight, and they aſhamed to go back without diſpatching their buſineſs, one of them went aſhore to the firſt Houſe to light the match, but before he was twenty Rods from the Water-ſide, he was ſeized on by two <hi>Blacks</hi> or rather <hi>Tawny-Moores,</hi> and by them haled above half a Mile up into the Countrey, and thrown with great violence upon his Belly, and ſo compelled to lye till they ſtript him, and more Company coming to them, they were ſo eager for his poor Canvas Apparel, that ſome they tore off, others they cut off, and with that ſeveral pieces of his Fleſh to his intolerable pain; With theſe Rags they made little Aprons to cover their Privities, clothing being very ſcarce there; The Boatſwain finding this <hi>J. W.</hi> was thus carried away, was reſolved with his other
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44690:36"/>two Companions to venture their Lives to have him again, and arming themſelves, they were ſuddenly beſet with about a doſen men in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Canoes,</hi> but they valiantly maintained their Boat about three hours, for after two or there three Muſquets were diſcharged, they defended themſelves with their Oars and Boat hooks; The Boatſwain received a mortal wound in his Groin, and fell down in the Boat, the other two adventured into the River, endeavouring by ſwimming to eſcape the Hands of theſe cruel Infidels, but the <hi>Negro</hi>'s with their ſwift <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi> ſoon overtook them, and brought them on Shore to the other; They took the Boatſwain out of the Boat, and inſtead of endeavouring to preſerve what Life remained in him, one of them with a keen Weapon inſtantly cut off his Head; And while he was yet reeking in his Blood, they in a barbarous manner cut off pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Fleſh from his Buttocks, Thighs, Arms, and Shoulders, and broil'd them on the Coals, and with much impatience eat it before his Companions Faces to their great aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>About a Fortnight after one of the Company fell ſick; And inſtead of being his Phyſicians to cure him, they were his Butchers to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him, cutting off his Head, and broiling and eating his Fleſh, rejoicing exceedingly at this rich Banquet. Ten days after the other fell ſick, whom they uſed in the very ſame manner. <hi>J.W.</hi> continued ſtill in Health though
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44690:36"/>the Natives daily expected ſuch another Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, becauſe it ſeems it is not their Cuſtom to kill thoſe that are well, and therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſell him; his Maſter was free to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, eſpecially ſince he had before learned the <hi>Tata</hi> Language in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> which is eaſily attained, being compreheneded in few words, and all the <hi>Negro</hi>'s ſpeak it. He began to diſcourſe his Maſter of the reaſon of their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, who told him, he ſhould be content, for if he were not ſick, he ſhould not have his Head cut off; In the Boat which they took there was one Musket ſaved that was not diſcharged, which his Maſter ſome time after brought to him to know the uſe of; <hi>J. W.</hi> endeavoured as much as poſſible to keep him in ignorance, but being threatned if he refuſed, at length he was forced to ſhoot it off, but the <hi>Negroes</hi> who expected ſome delightful thing were fruſtrated, and at the ſudden noiſe and flaſh of Fire, which they very much dread, ran from him extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted, but hearing no more noiſe came up to him again, and commanded him to do the like, he told them he had no Powder which cauſed the noiſe, but this would not ſatisfie theſe Barbarians, who were about to murder him for refuſal, had not his Maſter prevented it; Afterward in diſcourſe his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter told him, that the People were naturally civil, and ſimply honeſt, but if provoked full of Revenge, and that this cruelty toward him
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44690:37"/>and his Friends was occaſioned by the unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome carrying away ſome Native, without their leave about a year before, they reſolving if any came aſhore they ſhould never go off alive; He had not been above ſeven Weeks in the Countrey but his Maſter preſented him to the King, whoſe name was <hi>Eſme</hi> King of the <hi>Buckamores,</hi> who immediately gave him to his Daughter <hi>Onijah;</hi> When the King went abroad, he attended him as his Page through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole Circuit of his Dominions, which was not above twelve miles, yet boaſting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly of his Power and Strength, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying extreamly that he had a <hi>White</hi> to attend him, whom he imployed to carry his Bow and Arrows. At ſeveral places remote from the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, ſome of the People would run away from him for fear, others fell down and ſeem'd to worſhip him, uſing thoſe Actions they do to their Gods. Their Progreſs was never ſo long, but they could return home at Night, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver without a full Doſe of the Creature.</p>
               <p>During all the time <hi>J. W.</hi> was a Slave with him, he never knew him go abroad and come home ſober. They drink of the beſt Palm-wine, and of another Liquor called <hi>Peu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rore;</hi> The Engliſhman knew how to humour this profound Prince, and if any of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives abuſed him upon his complaint he had Redreſs, as once by ſtriving with a <hi>Negro,</hi> his Arm was broke, which by providence more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44690:37"/>than skill was ſet again; After ſome months, the King of <hi>Calanach</hi> called <hi>Mancha,</hi> hearing of this beautiful <hi>White,</hi> courted his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Prince to ſell him, and at length he was ſold for a Cow and a Goat; This King was very ſober, free from the Treacheries and Miſchiefs the other was ſubject to, and would oft inquire of him concerning his King and Countrey, and whether his Kingdoms were bigger than his own, whoſe whole Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not above twenty five miles in length, and fifteen in breadth; The <hi>Engliſhman</hi> told as much as he thought convenient, keeping with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the bounds of modeſty, yet relating as much as poſſible to the hononr and dignity of his Soveraign, firſt informing him of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one of his Kingdoms, the ſeveral Shires and Counties it contained, with the number of its Cities, Towns and Caſtles, and the ſtrength of each; the infinite Inhabitants and valour of his Subjects; One of theſe ſufficiently amazed this petty Governour, that he need mention no more of His Majeſties Glory and Dignity; It put him into ſuch a profound Conſternation, that he reſolved to find out ſome way to tender his reſpects to this Mighty Prince, and could ſtudy none more convenient, than that if he could find a paſſage he would let him go to <hi>England,</hi> to inform His Majeſty of the great favour and reſpect he had for him; This did not a little rejoice our <hi>Engliſhman;</hi> He alſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44690:38"/>told him that he would ſend him a Preſent, which ſhould be two Cabareets or Goats, which they there value at a very high rate, this King having himſelf not above ſeventeen or eighteen. He tells the King, that the King of <hi>England</hi> had many thouſand Subjects under the degree of Gentlemen, who had a thouſand Sheep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, the Fleſh of which they valued at a much higher rate than Goats.</p>
               <p>Though our Captive lived very happily with this King, yet his deſires and hopes were ſtill to return to his Native Countrey, at length he promiſed him, that the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship which came into the Road, ſhould have liberty to releaſe or purchaſe him; This very much rejoiced his Heart, now he thought eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day a year, till he could hear of, or ſee ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship arrived. Oft did he walk down to the Sea-ſide, earneſtly expecting the winds of Providence would blow ſome in thither, which being obſerved by one <hi>Jaga</hi> the chiefeſt Wizard in thoſe parts, and much admired by the People (though they have a multitude of others) this man came to him one day, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired why he went ſo often to the Sea-ſhore, he told him, to ſee if he could diſcover any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel come in there, and knowing he was a Wizard, though not acquainted with his great Fame, nor willing to credit his Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet to pleaſe him, askt when he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there would one come in; <hi>Jaga</hi> inſtantly
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44690:38"/>told him; <hi>That the fifteenth day after, an</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh <hi>Ship would come into the Road.</hi> He then demanded whether that Ship ſhould carry him away, to this he anſwered doubtfully, but told him, he ſhould be offered to the Maſter of the Ship, and if they ſhould not agree, but that he ſhould come aſhore again, and not be ſold, he would ſoon after dye of grief. Theſe fifteen days ſeemed very long, many a look did he caſt on the Sea with an aking Heart, the fourteenth day he went to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hill thereabout, but to no purpoſe, he could diſcover nothing, next Morning he went again two or three times but ſaw none, about two or three hours after, ſome of the <hi>Moors</hi> came running to the King, telling him there was a Canoe coming, ſo they call our Ships, at which our <hi>Engliſhman</hi> heartily rejoiced, hoping to be ſuddenly releaſt, yet durſt not ſhew it for fear of puniſhment or death, for though he lived better now than with his firſt Maſter, yet his Service was far worſe than the Slaves in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and their Diet worſe than Dogs meat, and therefore he had juſt cauſe of joy; The Ship came immediately in, and he runs proſently to <hi>Jaga</hi> to know if it were an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship, who aſſured him it was, and ſo it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; one Captain <hi>Royden</hi> being Commander; who haſtned to diſpatch his buſineſs, took in his <hi>Negroes,</hi> and was ready to Sail, our Captive not hearing a word what ſhould become of him,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44690:39"/>the King never offering to ſell him; This made him reſolve to endeavour an eſcape, to which end he had prepared a piece of Timber, and drawn it toward the water-ſide, on which he intended to paddle to the Ship, which-lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a League from the Shore.</p>
               <p>Juſt by the Sea-ſide as he was about to lanch his floating ſtick, he eſpied a great <hi>Alligator,</hi> which will devour a man at a mouthful, this altered his mind, reſolving rather to live with Infidels, than to be acceſſary to his own death; But the next day it pleaſed God to move the Kings Heart to let him go, ſending him in a Canoe placed between a <hi>Negro</hi>'s Legs, with ſome others to guide this ſmall Veſſel for fear he ſhould leap over-board, and ſwim to the Ship. At a diſtance he haled her in <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the great ſurprizal of thoſe within her, the <hi>Negro</hi>'s gave him leave to ſtand up and ſhow himſelf to the Captain, to whom he gave an Account, how four were left there, and he only remained alive. It was ſome time before they bargained, though the Captain was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to leave him behind. Several times the <hi>Negro</hi>'s padled away with their Canoe, reſolving not to part with him, but what with his intreaties and promiſes, he perſwaded them to the Ship again, and at laſt they delivered him on board for forty five Copper and Iron Bars about the bigneſs of a mans Finger; When he came on board, his Hair was very long, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44690:39"/>his Skin tawny like a Mulatto, having gone na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked all the time he was there, and uſually anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with Palm-Oyl, the Seamen very charitably apparalel'd him, and in ſhort time after he arrived ſafely in <hi>England</hi> with a thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Heart for ſo happy a deliverance. And here I ſhall conclude the view of <hi>Guinea.</hi>

               <p>BEfore I come to relate the Acquiſitions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> I will make an halt at the Iſland of St. <hi>Helena,</hi> This Iſle is now by His Majeſties Grace and Favour in the poſſeſſion of the Honourable <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, as a place for watering and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their long Voyages to the <hi>Indies;</hi> It was formerly ſeized by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but retaken <hi>May</hi> 6. 1673. by Captain <hi>Munday,</hi> with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44690:40"/>ſome other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and three rich <hi>Dutch Eaſt-India</hi> Prizes taken in the Harbour, ſince which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have fortified and ſecured it againſt any future Invaſion; It was ſo called by the <hi>Portugueſs,</hi> becauſe firſt diſcovered by them on St. <hi>Hellens</hi> day, being <hi>April</hi> 21. It lies in ſixteen degrees, and fifteen minutes of South Latitude in the main Ocean, about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred Miles from the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> three hundred and fifty from <hi>Angola,</hi> and five hundred and ten from <hi>Braſile,</hi> the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is about ſeven miles, lying high out of the Water, and ſurrounded on the Sea-coaſts with ſteep Rocks, having within many Cliffs, Mountains and Valleys, of which one is nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Church-Valley,</hi> where behind a ſmall Church they climb up to the Mountains. To the South is <hi>Apple-Dale,</hi> ſo called from the abundance of Oranges, Lemons and Pomegranats enough to furniſh five or ſix Ships. On the Weſt ſide of the Church, Ships have good Anchorage cloſe under the Shore, to prevent the Winds which blow fiercely from the adjacent high Mountains.</p>
               <p>The Air ſeems very temperate and healthful, inſomuch that ſick men brought aſhore there, in a ſhort time recover; Yet the heat in the Valleys is as intollerable as the eager cold upon the Mountains; It commonly rains there five or ſix times a day, ſo that the bareneſs of the Hills is not occaſioned for want of Water, of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44690:40"/>which it hath two or three good Springs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, for furniſhing Ships with freſh Water; The ground of its own accord brings forth wild Peaſe and Beans, alſo whole Woods of Orange, Lemon, and Pomegranat Trees all the year long laden both with Bloſſoms and Fruit, good Figs, abundance of Ebony and Roſe-trees, Parſly, Muſtard-ſeed, Purſlain, Sorrel, and the like; The Woods and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are full of Goats, very large Rams, and wild Swine, but difficult to be taken. When the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> firſt diſcovered it, they found neither four-footed Beaſts nor Fruit-trees, but only freſh Water; They afterward planted Fruit-trees, which ſo increaſed ſince, that at preſent all the Valleys ſtand full of them; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridges, Pigeons, Moor-hens, and Peacocks breed here very numerouſly, whereof a good Markſman may ſoon provide a Dinner for his Friends. On the Cliff-Iſlands, on the South are thouſands of grey and black Mews, or Sea-Pies, and alſo white and coloured Birds, ſome with long, others with ſhort Necks, who lay their Eggs on the Rocks, and are ſo unaccuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to fear, that they ſuffer themſelves to be taken with the Hand, and gaze at their ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, till they are knocked on the Head with ſticks.</p>
               <p>From the Salt-Water beating againſt the Cliffs a Froth or Scum remains in ſome places, which the heat of the Sun ſo purifies, that it
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44690:41"/>becomes white and good Salt; ſome of the Mountains yield Bole Armoniack, and a fat Earth like <hi>Terra Lemnia.</hi> The Sea will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the pains of a patient Fiſherman, who muſt uſe an Angle, not a Net, becauſe of the foul ground and beating of the waves, the chief are Mackrel, Roach, Carp, but differing in colour from thoſe among us; Eels as big as a mans Arm, and well taſted Crabs, Lobſters, Oyſters and Muſſels as good as <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

               <p>It is in this Iſland that the Scene of that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fancy, called. <hi>The Man in the Moon, or a diſcourſe of a Voyage thither,</hi> by <hi>Domingo Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſales</hi> is lay'd, written by a late Reverend and Learned Biſhop, ſaith the Excellent and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Biſhop <hi>Wilkins,</hi> who calls it a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and well contrived fancy, in his own Book intituled, <hi>A Diſcourſe of the New World, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove that it is poſſible there may be another habitable World in the Moon;</hi> Wherein among many other curious arguments he affirms, that this hath been the direct opinion of divers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and ſome Modern Mathematicians, and may probably be deduced from the Tenents of others, neither does it contradict any princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of reaſon nor Faith; And that as their World is our Moon, ſo our World is theirs.</p>
               <p>Now this ſmall Tract having ſo worthy a Perſon to vouch for the credit of it, and many of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians having publiſhed for Truth, what is altogether as improbable

I have not thought it amiſs to republiſh the Subſtance thereof, wherein the Author ſays he does not deſign to diſcourſe his Readers into a belief of each particular circumſtance, but expects that his new diſcovery of a <hi>New World</hi> may find little better entertainment than <hi>Columbus</hi> had in his firſt diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> though yet that poor eſpial betrayed ſo much knowledge as hath ſince increaſt to vaſt Improvements, and the then <hi>Unknown</hi> is now found to be of as large extent as all the other <hi>known World;</hi> That there ſhould be <hi>Antipodes</hi> was once thought as great a Paradox as now that the Moon ſhould be habitable. But the knowledge of this it may be is reſerved for this our diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering Age, wherein our <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> can by their Teleſcopes gaze the Sun into Spots, and deſcry Mountains in the Moon, but this and much more muſt be left to the Criticks, as well as the following faithful Relation of our little Eye witneſs and great Diſcoverer, which you ſhall have in his own <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Style, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered with that Grandeur and thirſt of Glory, which is generally imputed to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>It is ſufficiently known to all the Countries of <hi>Audaluzia,</hi> that I <hi>Domingo Gonſales</hi> was born of a Noble Family in the renowned City of <hi>Sevil</hi> in 1552. my Fathers name being <hi>Therando Gonſales</hi> near kinſman on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſide to <hi>Don Pedro Sanches</hi> the worthy Count of <hi>Almenara,</hi> My Mother was the Daughter of the Reverend and famous Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer <hi>Otho Perez de Sallaveda</hi> Governour of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and <hi>Corrigidor</hi> of <hi>Biſcay;</hi> I being the youngeſt of ſeventeen Children they had, was put to School, and deſigned by them to the Church; But Heaven purpoſing to uſe my Service in matters of far another Nature and quality, inſpired me with ſpending ſome time in the Wars; It was at the time that <hi>Don Ferrands,</hi> the Noble and thrice renowned Duke D' <hi>Alva</hi> was ſent into the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys in 1568.

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44690:42"/>ſet upon me, and bereaved me of my Horſe Money, and all, whereupon I was forc' through want and neceſſity to enter into the Service of Marſhal <hi>Coſſey</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Nobleman, whom I ſerved truly in a very honourable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, though mine Enemies to my diſgrace, affirm I was his Horſe-keepers Boy; But fot that matter, I refer my ſelf to Count <hi>Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Tavier,</hi> and other Perſons of Quality and condition, who have often teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to many worthy men now living, the very truth of the buſineſs, which indeed was this, Monſieur <hi>Coſſey</hi> being about this time ſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador to the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low Countreys,</hi> he underſtanding the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of my Birth, and my late misfortune, judging it would be no ſmall honour to him to have a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of that Quality about him, furniſhed me with a Horſe, Armour, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I wanted, uſing my Service in nothing ſo much, after I had learned <hi>French,</hi> as wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Letters, becauſe my Hand was then very fair. In time of War if upon neceſſity, I ſometime dreſſed my own Horſe, I ought not to be reproacht therewith, ſince I count it the part of a Gentleman to ſubmit to the vileſt Office for the Service of his Prince.</p>
               <p>The firſt expedition I was in, was when the Marſhal my Friend met the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> making a Road into <hi>France,</hi> and forced him to fly even to the Walls of <hi>Cambray;</hi> It was
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44690:43"/>my good Fortune to defeat a Trooper by kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Horſe with my Piſtol, who falling upon his Leg could not ſtir, but yielded to my mercy; I knowing my own weakneſs of Body, and ſeeing him a luſty tall Fellow, thought it the ſureſt way to diſpatch him, which having done, I plundered him of a Chain, Money, and other things to the value of 200 Ducats, This Money was no ſooner in my Pockets, but I began to reſume the remembrance of my Nobility, and taking my audience of leave from Monſieur <hi>Coſſey,</hi> I inſtantly repaired to the Duke <hi>D' Alva</hi>'s Court, where divers of my Kindred ſeeing my Pocket full of good Crowns, were ready enough to acknowledge me; By their means I was received into pay, and in time obtained a good degree of favour with the Duke, who would ſometimes jeſt a little more ſeverely at my Perſonage than I could well bear, for though I muſt acknowledge my Stature is ſo little, as I think no man living is leſs, yet ſince it is the work of Heaven, and not my own, he ought not to have upbraided a Gentleman therewith; And thoſe glorious things that have happened to me may evince, that great and wonderful matters may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by very unlikely Bodies, if the mind be good, and Fortune ſecond our endeavours;</p>
               <p>Though the Dukes joques a little diſguſted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e, yet I endeavoured to conceal my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and accommodating my ſelf to ſome
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44690:43"/>other of his humors, I was ſo far intereſted in his favour, that at his going into <hi>Spain</hi> in 1573. whither I attended him, by his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſome other accidents, wherein by my Induſtry I was ſeldom wanting to my ſelf, I was able to carry home 3000 Crowns in my Pocket.</p>
               <p>At my return my Parents, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſturbed at my departure, received me with great joy, which was increaſed becauſe they found I had brought wherewith to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my ſelf without being chargable to them, ſo that they need not leſſen the Portions of my Brothers and Siſters to provide for me. But doubting I would ſpend it as lightly as I got it, they continually ſollicited me to marry the Daughter of <hi>John Figueres</hi> a conſiderable Merchant of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to which I complied, and putting my Marriage Money, and good part of my own into the hands of my Father, or ſuch as he adviſed me to, I lived in good faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and much like a Gentleman for many years very happily; At length ſome quarrels ariſing between me and one <hi>Pedro Delgades</hi> a Gentleman and Kinſman of mine, the cauſes whereof are needleſs to relate, this difference grew to ſuch a height, that when no mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Friends could prevail, we two went alone with our Swords into the Field, where it was my chance to kill him, though a ſtout proper man, but what I wanted in ſtrength I
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44690:44"/>ſupplied in courage, and my agility countervail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Stature. This being acted in <hi>Carmona,</hi> I fled with all ſpeed to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> thinking to conceal my ſelf with ſome Friends of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law, till the buſineſs might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, and I acquitted by conſent of the Proſecutors. This happened in 1596 at which time, a famous <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Count coming from the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> publiſhed Triumphant Declarations in Print, of a great Victory he had obtained againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> near the <hi>Iſle of Pines,</hi> whereas in reality he got nothing at all in that Voyage but blows, and a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble loſs. It had been well if vanity and lying had been his only crimes; His covetouſneſs had like to have been my utter ruin, though ſince it hath proved the occaſion of Eternizing my name I verily believe to all Poſterity, and to the unſpeakable benefit of all Mortals for ever hereafter, at leaſt if it pleaſe Heaven that I return home ſafe to my Countrey, and give perfect Inſtructions how thoſe almoſt incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and impoſſible Acquirements may be imparted to the World. You ſhall then ſee men flying in the Air from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you ſhall then be able to ſend Meſſages many hundred miles in an inſtant, and receive anſwers thereto immediately, without the help of any Creature upon Earth; You ſhall then preſently impart your mind to your Friend though in the moſt remote and obſcure place
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44690:44"/>of a populous City, and a multitude of other notable Experiments; But what exceeds all, you ſhall then have the diſcovery of a <hi>New World,</hi> and abundance of rare and incredible ſecrets of Nature, which the Philoſophers of former Ages never ſo much as dreamt of; But I muſt be cautious in publiſhing theſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful myſteries, till our Stateſmen have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how they may conſiſt with the Policy and good Government of our Countrey, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, whether the Fathers of the Church may not judge the divulging them prejudicial to the Affairs of the Catholick Faith and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which (by thoſe wonders I have ſeen above any mortal man before me) I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to advance with my utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, without reſpect to any temporal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with my Narrative, this huffing Captain aforenamed, pretended much diſcontent for the death of the ſaid <hi>Delgades,</hi> who was indeed ſome Kin to him, however he was willing to be quiet if I would have given him a thouſand Duckets; I had now, beſides a Wife, two Sons, whom I was not willing to begger, only to ſatisfie the avaritious humour of this Boaſter, and was therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated to take ſome other courſe; I imbarkt in a ſtout Carrick bound for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> carrying the value of two thouſand Duckets to Trade with, leaving as much more for the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44690:45"/>ſupport of my Wife and Children behind me, whatever misfortune might happen to me; In the <hi>Indies</hi> I thrived exceedingly, laying out my Stock in Diamonds, Emeralds and Pearls, which I bought at ſuch eaſy rates, that my Stock ſafely arriving in <hi>Spain</hi> (as I underſtood it did) muſt needs yield ten for one. But for my ſelf having doubled <hi>Cape buona Eſperanca</hi> in my way home, I fell dangerouſly ſick, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but death, which had then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly happened, but that we juſt then recovered the Bleſſed Iſle of St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> the only Paradice I believe on Earth, for healthful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Air, and fruitfulneſs of Soil, producing all neceſſaries for the Life of man; It is about three Leagues in compaſs, and has no firm Land or Continent within 300 Leagues, nay not ſo much as an Iſland within an hundred Leagues of it, ſo that it may ſeem a Miracle of Nature, that out of ſo vaſt and tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an Ocean, ſuch a ſmall Rock or piece of ground ſhould ariſe and diſcover it ſelf. On the South is a good Harbour, and near it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſmall Houſes built by the <hi>Portugueſs</hi> to accommodate Strangers, with a pretty Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel handſomely beautified with a Tower, and a fair Bell therein. Near it is a Stream of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent freſh water, divers handſome walks planted on both ſides with Orange, Lemmod, Pomegranate, Almond-trees and the like, which are Fruit all the year, as do alſo divers others;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44690:45"/>There are ſtore of Garden Herbs, with Wheat, Peaſe, Barley, and moſt kinds of Pulſe, but it chiefly aboundeth with Cattel and Fowl, as Goats, Swine, Sheep, Partridges, wild Hens, Pheaſants, Pigeons, and wild Fowl beyond credit; But eſpecially about <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March</hi> are to be ſeen huge Flocks of a kind of <hi>Wild Swans,</hi> (whereof I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more hereafter) who like our Cuckoes and Nightingales, go away at a certain Seaſon, and are no more ſeen that year.</p>
               <p>On this happy Iſland did they ſet me aſhore with a <hi>Negro</hi> to attend me, where praiſed be Heaven, I recovered my health, and continued there a whole year, ſolacing my ſelf for want of Humane Society with Birds and bruit Beaſts; <hi>Diego</hi> my Black-moor was forced to live in a Cave at the Weſt-end of the Iſle, for had we dwelt together, Victuals would not have been ſo plenty with us; But now if one ſucceeded well in Hunting or Fowling, the other would find means to invite and treat him, and if both miſt, we were then fain to look out ſharply, but this very ſeldom happened, ſince no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there fears a man more than they do a Goat or Cow, whereby I eaſily tamed divers kinds of Birds and Beaſts in a ſhort time by only muzling them, ſo that till they came either to me or <hi>Diego</hi> they could not ſeed; At firſt I much delighted in a kind of Patridges, and a tame Fax, whereof I made good uſe; For if
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44690:46"/>I had occaſion to confer with <hi>Diego,</hi> I would take one of them muzled and hungry, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a note about his Neck, beat him from me, whereupon he would ſtreight away to <hi>Diego's</hi> Cave, and if he were not there, would beat about till they found him, yet this conveyance being not without ſome inconvenience need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to be mentioned, after a while I perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Diego,</hi> (who though a Fellow of good Parts, was content to be ruled by me) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to a Promontory or Cape on the north-weſt part of the Iſland, being though a League off, yet within ſight of my Houſe and Chappel, and then when the weather was fair, we could at all times by ſignals declare our minds each to other in an inſtant either by Night or Day, wherein we took much pleaſure. If in the Night I would ſignifie any thing to him, I uſed to ſet up a light in the Bell Tower, which was a pretty large Room with a fair Window well glaſed, and the Walls within being plaiſtered were exceeding white, by reaſon whereof, though the light were but ſmall, it made a great ſhow, and would have done much farther off, if there had been need. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this light had ſtood half an hour I covered it, and then if I ſaw any ſignal of light again from my Companion at the Cape, I knew he waited for my notice, and ſo by hiding and ſhewing my light according to a certain Rule or Agreement betwixt us, I certified him of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44690:46"/>what I pleaſed. In the day I advertiſed him by Smoke, Duſt, and ſometimes by a more refined and effactual way. This Art contains many Myſteries, and may be very uſeful if well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding after a while I grew weary of it as too painful, and again uſed my Winged Meſſengers; Upon the Shoar, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially about the Mouth of our River, I found great ſtore of a certain kind of <hi>Wild Swans</hi> aforementioned, feeding uſually upon prey, and that both of Fiſh and Birds, and which is more ſtrange having one Claw like an Eagle, and the other like a Swan, Theſe Birds com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly breeding here in infinite numbers, I took thirty or forty of them young, and bred them up by hand for recreation, yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome thoughts of that Experiment which I after put in practice. Theſe being ſtrong and able to continue a great flight, I taught them firſt to come at call afar off, not uſing any noiſe, but only ſhewing them a White Cloth, and here I found it true what <hi>Plutarch</hi> affirms, <hi>That Creatures which eat Fleſh are more deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than others.</hi> 'Tis wonderful to think what Tricks I taught them ere they were a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter old, amongſt others I uſed them by degrees to fly with Burdens, wherein I found them able beyond belief, and brought them ſo forward, that a White Sheet being diſplayed to them by <hi>Diego</hi> upon the ſide of a Hill, they would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44690:47"/>from me to him Bread, Fleſh, or whatever I pleaſed, and upon the like call come to me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. Having proceeded thus far, I began to conſult how I might join a number of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, ſo as to carry a heavier weight, which if I could compaſs, I might thereby ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a man to fly and be carried ſafely in the Air from one place to another. I puzled my Wits extreamly with this thought, and upon Trial found that if many were put to the bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of one great Burthen, by reaſon it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible all of them ſhould riſe together juſt at one inſtant, the firſt that raiſed himſelf upon his Wings finding himſelf ſtayed by a weight heavier than he could move or ſtir, would ſoon give over, and ſo the ſecond, third, and all the reſt. I contrived at laſt a way whereby each might riſe with only his own proportion of weight, I faſtned about each <hi>Ganſa</hi> a little Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Cork,</hi> and putting a ſtring of a juſt length through it, I faſtened one end to a block of almoſt eight pound weight, and tyed a two pound weight to the other end of the String, and then cauſing the ſignal to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, they preſently all roſe together, being four in number, and carried away my Block to the place appointed. This hitting ſo luckily, I added two or three Birds more, and made Tryal of their carrying a Lamb, whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs I much envied that he ſhould be the firſt living creature to partake of ſuch an excellent device.</p>

               <p>At length after divers Tryals, I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with a great longing to cauſe my ſelf to be carried in the ſame manner, <hi>Diego</hi> my Moor was likewiſe poſſeſt with the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and had I not loved him well, and want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Service, I ſhould have reſented this his ambitious thought; For I count it greater honour to have been the firſt <hi>Flying Man,</hi> than to be another <hi>Neptune</hi> who firſt adventured to Sail on the Sea. Yet ſeeming not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his intention, I only told him that all my <hi>Gauſa's</hi> were not ſtrong enough to carry him, being a man though of no great Bulk, yet twice heavier than my ſelf; Having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all neceſſaries, I one time placed my ſelf and all my Utenſils on the top of a Rock at the Rivers Mouth, and putting my ſelf upon my Engine at full Sea, I cauſed <hi>Diego</hi> to advance the ſignal, whereupon my Birds, 25 in number preſently roſe all at once, and carried me over luſtily to the Rock on the other ſide, being about a quarter of a League; I choſe this time and place, becauſe if any thing had fallen out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to expectation, the worſt that could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen was my only falling into the Water, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſwim well, I hoped to receive little hurt in my fall; When I was once ſafe over, O how did my heart even ſwell with Joy and admiration at my own Invention; How oft did I wiſh my ſelf in the midſt of <hi>Spain,</hi> that I might ſpeedily fill the World with the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44690:49"/>fame of my Glory and Renown? Every hour I had a longing deſire for the coming of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet to take me home with them, but they ſtay'd, by what miſchance I know not, three Months beyond their uſual time; At length they arrived being three Carricks much weather-beaten, the men generally exceeding Sick and Weak, and were therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to refreſh themſelves in our Iſland a whole Month; The Admiral was called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſo de Xima,</hi> a Vallant Wiſe Man, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of Glory, and worthy better Fortune than afterward befell him; To him I diſcovered my device of the <hi>Ganſa's,</hi> being ſatisfied, that it was abſolutely impoſſible otherwiſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to take ſo many Birds into his Ship, who for the niceneſs of their proviſion, would be more troubleſom than ſo many men; Yet I adjured him by all manner of Oaths and Perſwaſions to deal ingeniouſly with me, and to be ſecret in the buſineſs, though of the laſt I did not much doubt, aſſuring my ſelf he durſt not impart the Experiment to any before our King were acquainted therewith. Of the firſt I had more apprehenſion, leſt Ambition and the deſire of gaining to himſelf the honour of ſo admirable an Invention, ſhould tempt him to diſpatch me. However I was forc't to run the Riſque of it unleſs I would adventure the loſs of my Birds, the like whereof for my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe were not to be had in Chriſtendom, nor
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44690:49"/>was I ſure ever to bring others to ſerve my turn.</p>
               <p>It happened all theſe doubts were cauſleſs, the man I believe was honeſt, yet if he had deſigned otherwiſe, I lay'd a Plot to diſcover him, but the misfortune we met with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all theſe thoughts, <hi>Thurſday June</hi> 21. 1599. we ſet Sail for <hi>Spain,</hi> I having allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me a very convenient Cabbin for my Birds, and Room for my Engine, which the Captain would have perſwaded me to have le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t behind me, and it was a wonder I did not, but my good fortune therein ſaved my life, for after two Months Sail it happened we met with an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet about 10 Leagues from the Iſland of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> one of the <hi>Canaries</hi> famous throughout the World for a Hill therein cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pico,</hi> which is kenned at Sea above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Leagues off. We had aboard five times their number of men, all in good health, and were well provided with Ammunition, yet finding them reſolved to fight, and knowing what infinite riches we carried, concluded it better if poſſible to eſcape, than by encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring a crew of deſperate Fellows, to hazard not only our own Lives, which a man of courage in this caſe does not value, but the Eſtates of many poor Merchants, who I am afraid were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the miſcarriage of this buſineſs. Our Fleet conſiſted of five Sail, that is, three Carricks, a Bark, and a Caravel, who coming from
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44690:50"/>St. <hi>Thomas Iſle,</hi> had in an ill hour overtaken us ſome few days before. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> had three Ships well provided, who no ſooner ſpied but preſently ingaged us, and changing their courſe, endeavoured to bring us under their Lee, which they might eaſily do as the Wind then ſtood, they being light nimble Veſſels, as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ships generally are, ours heavy, deep laden, and foul with the Sea. Our Captain therefore reſolved, wiſely enough it may be, but neither valiantly nor fortunately, to fly, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to diſperſe our ſelves. The Caravel by too much haſt fell upon one of the Carricks and bruiſed her ſo, that one of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who undertook her eaſily fetcht her up and entred her, the Caravel ſinking immediately before our eyes. The Bark for ought I could perceive eſcaped unpurſued, and another of our Carricks after ſome chaſe was given over by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who expecting a ſufficient Booty of us, and getting us between them, fell upon us with much fury, our Captain hereupon gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to run aſhoar upon <hi>Tenariff,</hi> the Port whereof we could not recover, ſaying, <hi>That he hoped to ſave part of the Goods, and ſome of our Lives, and he had rather the reſt ſhould be loſt, than all fall into the mercy of our foes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When I heard this Reſolution, obſerving the Sea to work high, and knowing all the Coaſt to be ſo full of Rocks and Shoals, that it was impoſſible our Ship ſhould come near the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44690:50"/>Land unleſs broken into a thouſand pieces, I repreſented to the Captain the deſperateneſs of the attempt, wiſhing him rather to try the kindneſs of the Enemy, than throw away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and ſo many brave men; But he would by no Remonſtrances be removed in the leaſt from his Reſolution, therefore finding it high time to ſhift for my ſelf, I lockt up my little Casket of Jewels, which putting into my ſleeve, I then betook me to my <hi>Ganſa</hi>'s, and having harnaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to my Engine, and put my ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuppoſing, as indeed it happened, that when the Ship ſhould ſplit, my Birds though they wanted their ſignal, yet for ſaving their own lives, which nature hath taught all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to preſerve to the utmoſt, would make toward Land, which fell out, thanks be to Heaven, according to my expectation; The People in the Ship wondred what I was doing, none being acquainted with the uſe of my Birds but the Captain, <hi>Diego</hi> being in the other Ship which fled away unpurſued; We were about half a League from Land, when our Carrick ſtruck upon a Rock, and ſplit inſtantly to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, upon which I let looſe the reins to my Birds, having firſt placed my ſelf upon the top of the Deck, and with the Shock they all aroſe carrying me fortunately to the Land, of which you need not doubt but I was very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, though it was a miſerable ſight to behold my Friends and acquaintance in that woful
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44690:51"/>diſtreſs, of whom yet many eſcaped better than they expected, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lanching out their Cock-boats, diſcovered more noble and generous tempers than we are pleaſed to allow them, taking compaſſion of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and endeavouring with all diligence to ſave them from the fury of the Waves though with much danger to themſelves, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers they took up our Captain, who, as Father <hi>Pacio</hi> ſince told me, having put himſelf with twelve others into the Cock-boat, was forced to yield to one Captain <hi>Raymundo,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him together with our Pilot along with them in their Voyage toward the <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> whither they were bound, but it was their hard fate by a breach of the Sea neer Cape <hi>Buona Eſperanca</hi> to be ſwallowed of the Mercileſs Waves, whoſe Rage they a while before had ſo hardly eſcaped; The reſt as I likewiſe heard, who where in all about twenty ſix Perſons that they took into their Ship, they ſet them a land ſoon after at <hi>Cape Verde.</hi>

               <p>As for my ſelf being now aſhoar in an Iſland inhabited generally by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I reckoned I was ſafe, but I ſoon found my ſelf much miſtaken, for it was my hap to pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that part of the Iſle where the <hi>Pike</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned begins to riſe, which is inhabited by a Savage kind of People who live upon the ſides of that Hill, the top whereof is for the moſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44690:51"/>part covered with Snow, and formerly account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for its monſtrous height and Steepneſs inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible either for man or Beaſt, yet theſe Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages fearing the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> keep themſelves as neer the top as they can, where they had divers places of good ſtrength, never coming down into the fruitful valleys but to ſeek for Booty, a crew of thoſe Out-Laws happened to ſpy me ſoon after I landed, and thinking they had got a prize, approacht me with all ſpeed, yet not ſo privately but I gueſt their deſign before they came within half a Mile, when perceiving them to come haſtily down the Hill directly toward me, with long ſtaves and other Weapons, which at that diſtance I could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, I thought it neceſſary immediately to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure my ſelf from the hands of theſe Villains, who had they taken me, out of hatred to us <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> would have certainly cut me to peices; The Countrey in that place was Sandy, but the <hi>Pike</hi> beginning even there to lift up it ſelf, I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpied in the ſide thereof a white Cliff, which I hoped my <hi>Ganza's</hi> would take for a Mark, and being put up, would make all that way, whereby I might quickly be carried ſo far that thoſe Barbarous Raskals ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> be able to overtake me, before I had got to ſome <hi>Spaniards</hi> Houſe, or might at leaſt gain time to hide my ſelf from them, till by the covert of the night I might travel to <hi>Laguna</hi> the chief City of the Iſland, and not above three Miles off,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44690:52"/>with all celerity therefore I ſetled my ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Engine, and let looſe the Reins to my <hi>Ganſa's,</hi> by good fortune they took all one courſe, though not juſt the way I aimed at. But what of that! O Reader prick up thy Ears and prepare thy ſelf to hear the ſtrangeſt chance that ever happened to any Mortal Man, and which I know thou wilt not have the grace to believe till thou ſeeſt the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, which I doubt not in a ſhort time may be performed. My <hi>Ganſa's</hi> like ſo many Horſes that had gotten the bit between their Teeth, made not their flight, as I ſaid toward the Cliff I intended, though I uſed my wonted means to direct the Leader of the Flock that way, but with might and main took up toward the top of the <hi>Pike,</hi> and never ſtoot till they came there, a place where they ſay never man came before, being in vulgar eſtimation <hi>(though ſince experimentally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted)</hi> at leaſt fifteen Miles in height above the ordinary Level of the Land and Sea; What kind of place I found this I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate, but that I haſten to matters of far greater Importance; When I was there ſet down my poor <hi>Ganſa's</hi> fell to panting, blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gaping for breath as if they would all preſently have died, therefore I thought good not to trouble them a while, forbearing to drawn them in, which they never uſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure without ſtrugling, but little did I expect what followed.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:44690:52"/>
               <p>It was now the ſeaſon that theſe Birds were wont to take their flight away, as our Cucko's and Swallows do in <hi>Spain</hi> toward <hi>Autumn,</hi> and as I afterward found, being mindful of their uſual Voyage juſt when I began to ſettle my ſelf to take them in they as it were with one conſent roſe up, and having no other higher place to make toward, to my unſpeakable fear and amazement, ſtruck bolt upright, and never left towring upward, ſtill higher and higher, for the ſpace as I gueſt, of an Hour, after which I thought they laboured leſs than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, till at length, ah moſt wonderful! they forbore moving any thing at all, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained immoveable as ſteadily as if they had ſate upon ſo many perches, the lines ſlacked, neither I, nor the Engine moved at all, but continued ſtill, as having no manner of weight. I found then by Experience what no Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ever dream't of, namely, that thoſe things which we call heavy do not fall toward the center of the Earth as their natural place, but are drawn by a ſecret property of the Globe of the Earth, or rather ſomething within it, even as the Load-ſtone draweth Iron which is within the Compaſs of its attractive Beams. For though in this place my <hi>Ganſa</hi>'s could continue unmoved without being ſuſtained by any thing whatſoever but the Air as eaſily and quietly as a Fiſh in the middle of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet if they forced themſelves never ſo
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44690:53"/>little it is impoſſible to imagine with what ſwiftneſs they were carried, either upward, downward or ſide ways; I muſt ingeniouſly confeſs my horrour and amazement in this place was ſuch, that had I not been arm'd with a true <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Courage and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution I ſhould certainly have died for fear.</p>
               <p>But the next thing that diſturb'd me was the ſwiftneſs of the motion, which was ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary that it even almoſt ſtopt my breath if I ſhould liken it to an Arrow out of a Bow, or a Stone thrown down from the top of an high Tower, it would come vaſtly ſhort of it; Another thing was exceeding troubleſom to me, that is the Illuſions of Devils and Wicked Spirits, who the firſt day of my arrival came about me in great numbers in the ſhapes and likeneſs of Men and Women, wondring at me like ſo many Birds about an Owl, and ſpeaking ſeveral Languages which I underſtood not, till at laſt I met with ſome that ſpoke very good <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> ſome <hi>Dutch,</hi> and others <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> all which I underſtood; And here I had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a touch of the Suns abſence once for a ſhort time, having him ever after in my ſight. Now though my <hi>Ganſa's</hi> were entangled in my lines, yet had they means eaſily to ſeize upon divers kinds of Flies and Birds, eſpecially Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows and Cuckoes whereof there were multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes even like Motes in the Sun, though to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44690:53"/>ſay truth I never ſaw them eat any thing at all. As for my ſelf I was I'le aſſure you very much obliged to thoſe, whether Men or Devils I know not, who among divers diſcourſes which I will forbear a while to repeat, told me, <hi>If I would follow their Directions, I ſhould not only be carried ſafe home, but be aſſured to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at all times all the pleaſures of that place.</hi> To which motion not daring to give a flat denial, I deſired time to conſider, and withal intreated them, (though I felt no hunger at all, which may ſeem ſtrange) to help me to ſome Victuals leaſt I ſhould ſtarve in my Journey; Whereupon they readily brought me very good Fleſh and Fiſh of ſeveral ſorts and well dreſt, but that it was extream freſh without any reliſh of Salt; Wine likewiſe I taſted of divers kinds as good as any in <hi>Spain,</hi> and Beer no better in all <hi>Antwerp.</hi> They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me that while I had opportunity I ſhould make my Proviſions, telling me that till the next <hi>Thurſday</hi> they could help me to no more, if happily then, at which time they would find means to carry me back, and ſet me ſafe in <hi>Spain</hi> in any place I would deſire, provided I would become one of their Fraternity, and enter into ſuch Covenants as they had made to their Captain and Maſter whom they would not name, I anſwered civilly, telling them, <hi>I ſaw little reaſon to rejoice in ſuch an offer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring them to be mindful of me as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:44690:54"/>So for that time I was rid of them, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt furniſhed my Pockets with as much Victuals as I could thruſt in, among which I would be ſure to find a place for a ſmall Bottle of good Canary.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now declare the quality of the place wherein I then was; The Clouds I perceived to be all under between me and the Earth. The Stars, becauſe it was always day, I ſaw at all times alike, not ſhining bright as we ſee in the night upon Earth, but of a whitiſh colour like the Moon with us in the day time, thoſe that were ſeen, which were not many, ſhewed far greater than with us, yea as I gueſt no leſs than ten times bigger; As for the Moon, being then within 2 days of the change, ſhe appeared of an huge and dreadful greatneſs. It is not to be forgot that no Stars appeared but on that part of the Hemiſphere next the Moon, and the nearer to her, the larger they appear'd. Again, whether I lay quiet and reſted, or were carried in the Air, I perceived my ſelf to be always directly between the Moon and the Earth, whereby 'tis plain that my <hi>Ganſa's</hi> took their way directly toward the Moon, and alſo that when we reſted, as we did at firſt for many hours, either we were inſenſibly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried round about the Globe of the Earth, though I perceived no ſuch motion, or elſe that according to the opinion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> the Earth is carried about, and turneth round
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44690:54"/>perpetually from Weſt to Eaſt, leaving to the Planets only that motion which the Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers call natural, and is not upon the Poles of the Equinoctial, commonly called the Poles of the World, but upon thoſe of the Zodiack; The Air in that place I found quiet without any motion of wind, and exceeding temperate, neither hot nor cold, as where neither the Sun beams had any Subject to reflect upon, nor the Earth and Water ſo near to affect the Air with their natural Quality of coldneſs; As for that imagination of the Philoſophers attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting heat and moiſture to the Air, I alwaies eſteem'd it a fancy; Laſtly, I remember that after my departure from the Earth, I never felt either hunger or thirſt, whether the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Air, freed from the Vapors of the Earth and Water, might yeild nature ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient nouriſhment, or what elſe might be the cauſe I cannot determine, but ſo I found it, though I was perfectly in health both of body and mind, even above my uſual Vigor. Let us now proceed, which we ſhall do faſt enough for the future.</p>
               <p>Some hours after the departure of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh Company my <hi>Ganſa's</hi> began to beſtir themſelves, ſtill directing their courſe toward the Globe or body of the Moon, making their way with ſuch incredible ſwiftneſs, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive they advanced little leſs than fifty Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44690:55"/>in an hour, in which paſſage I obſerved three things very Remarkable, one that the farther we went the leſs the Globe of the Earth appear'd to us, and that of the Moon ſtill lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and more monſtrous; Again the Earth, which I had ever in mine eye, ſeemed to mask it ſelf with a kind of brightneſs like another Moon, and as we diſcern certain Spots or Clouds as it were in the Moon, ſo did I then ſee the like in the Earth, but whereas the form of thoſe Spots in the Moon are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, theſe on the Earth ſeemed by degrees to change every hour, the reaſon whereof ſeems to be, that whereas the Earth according to his natural motion (for ſuch a motion I am now ſatisfied ſhe hath according to the opinion of <hi>Copernicus</hi>) turns round up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her own Axis every four and twenty hours from Weſt to Eaſt) I ſhould at firſt ſee in the middle of the Body of this New Star the Earth, a Spot like a Pear with a Morſel bit out on one ſide, in ſome hours I ſhould obſerve this Spot move away toward the Eaſt; This no doubt was the main Land of <hi>Africa;</hi> Then might I perceive a great ſhining brightneſs in that place which continued about the ſame time, and was queſtionleſs the vaſt <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean; After this ſucceeded a Spot almoſt Oval, juſt as we ſee <hi>America</hi> deſcribed in our Maps, then another immenſe cleerneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44690:55"/>
                  <hi>Mare del Zur</hi> or the <hi>South Sea,</hi> and laſtly a number of Spots like the Countreys and Iſlands in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> ſo that it ſeemed to me no other than an huge Mathematical Globe turned round leiſurely before me, wherein ſucceſſively all the Countreys of our earthly World were within twenty four hours repreſented to my view, and this was all the means I now had to number the days, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the time.</p>
               <p>I could now wiſh that Philoſophers and Mathematicians would confeſs their own blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who have hitherto made the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Earth hath no motion, and to confirm it are forc't to attribute to every one of the celeſtial Bodies two Motions directly contrary to each other, one from the Eaſt to the Weſt to be perform'd in twenty four hours with an impetuous rapid motion, the other from Weſt to Eaſt in ſeveral proportions; O incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible ſuppoſition! That thoſe huge Bodies of the fixed Stars in the higheſt Orb, whereof they confeſs divers are above an hundred times bigger than the whole Earth, ſhould like ſo many Nails in a Cart wheel be whirled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in ſo ſhort a time, whereas it is many thouſand years, no leſs (ſay they) than thirty thouſand, before that Orb finiſhes his courſe from Weſt to Eaſt, which they call his natural motion; Now whereas they allow their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courſe from Weſt to Eaſt to every one of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44690:56"/>them, therein they do well; The Moon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms it in ſeven and twenty days, the <hi>Sun, Venus and Mercury</hi> in a year or thereabout, <hi>Mars</hi> in three year, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in twelve, and <hi>Saturn</hi> in thirty. But to attribute to theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Bodies contrary motions at once, is a very abſurd conceit, and much more to imagine the ſame Orb wherein the fixed Stars are, whoſe natural courſe takes up ſo many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years, ſhould be turned about every twenty four hours. I will not go ſo far as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus</hi> who makes the Sun the center of the Earth and immoveable, neither will I be poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in any thing, only this I ſay, allow the Earth its motion, which theſe eyes of mine can teſtify to be true, and all thoſe abſurdities are removed, every one having only his own ſingle and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motion.</p>
               <p>But where am I? I promiſed an hiſtory, and am unawares turn'd diſputer. One Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent more befell worth mention, that during my ſtay I ſaw a kind of a reddiſh Cloud com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward me, and continually approaching nearer, which at laſt I perceived was nothing but a huge ſwarm of Locuſts. He that reads the diſcourſes of learned men concerning them, as <hi>John Leo</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> and others who relate that they are ſeen in the Air ſeveral days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they fall on the Earth, and add thereto this experience of mine, will eaſily conclude that they can come from no other place than
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44690:56"/>the Globe of the Moon. But now give me leave to go on quietly in my Journey for eleven or twelve days, during all which time I was carried directly toward the Globe or Body of the Moon, with ſuch a violent Whir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling as is inexpreſſible, for I cannot imagine a Bullet out of a Cannon could make way through the vaporous and muddy Air neer the Earth with half that celerity, which is the more ſtrange ſince my <hi>Ganſa's</hi> moved their Wings but now and then, and ſometimes for a quarter of an hour not at all, only holding them ſtretcht out, as we ſee Kites, and Eagles ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do for a ſhort ſpace, during which pauſes I ſuppoſe they took their Naps, and times of Sleeping, for other time I could perceive they never had any; For my ſelf I was ſo faſtened to mine Engine that I durſt ſlumber enough to ſerve my turn, which I took with as great eaſe, though it may ſeem incredible, as if I had lain on the beſt Down-Bed in all <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After eleven days paſſage in this violent flight, I perceived we began to approach to another Earth (if I may ſo call it) being the Globe or very Body of that Star which we call the Moon. The firſt difference I found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and our Earth was, that it appeared in its natural colours as ſoon as ever I was free from the attraction of the Earth; Whereas with us, a thing a League or two from us puts on that deadly colour of Blew. I then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44690:57"/>alſo that this World was the greateſt part covered with a huge mighty Sea, thoſe parts only being dry Land which are unto us ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what darker than the reſt of her Body, I mean, what the Countrey people call, <hi>The Man in the Moon,</hi> and that part which ſhines ſo bright is another. Ocean beſprinkled with Iſlands, which for their ſmalneſs we cannot diſcern ſo far off; So that the Splendor which appears to us in the Night, is nothing but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection of the Sun beams returned to us out of the Water as from a Lookinglaſs. How much this diſagrees with what our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers teach in the Schools is very evident; But alas how many of their Errors hath time and experience refuted in this our Age, and among other vain conjectures, who hath not hitherto believed the upper Region of the Air to be very hot, as being next, forſooth, to the natural place of the Element of Fire; Meer Vanities, Fancies and Dreams; For after I was once free from the attractive Beams of that Tyranous Load-ſtone the Earth, I found the Air altogether ſerene, without Winds, Rain, Miſts or Clouds, neither hot nor cold, but conſtantly pleaſant, calm and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble till my arrival in that <hi>New World of the Moon;</hi> As for that Region of fire our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers talk of, I heard no news of it, mine eyes have ſufficiently inform'd me there is no ſuch thing.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:44690:57"/>
               <p>The Earth had now by turning about ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me all her parts twelve times when I fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed my courſe; For when by my reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſeem'd to be (as indeed it was) <hi>Tueſday September</hi> 11. at which time the Moon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two days old was in the twentieth degree of <hi>Libra</hi>) my <hi>Ganſa's</hi> ſeem'd by one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to ſtay their courſe, and reſted for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hours, after which they took their flight, and in leſs than an hour ſet me on the top of an high Hill in that <hi>Other World,</hi> where many moſt ſtrange and wonderful things were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preſented to my ſight, for I obſerved firſt, that though the Globe of the Earth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd much greater there than the Moon doth to us, even three times bigger, yet all things there were ten, twenty, yea thirty times lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than ours; Their Trees were thrice as high, and above five times broader and thicker; So were there Herbs, Birds, and Beaſts, though I cannot well compare them to ours, becauſe I found not any kind of Beaſt or Bird there which any way reſembled ours, except Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Nightingals, Cuckoes, Woodcocks, Batts, and ſome kind of Wild Fowl; And likewiſe ſuch Birds as my <hi>Ganſa's,</hi> all which as I now perceived, ſpend their time in their abſence from us, in that World, neither do they differ in any thing from ours, but are the very ſame kind.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was I upon the ground, but I
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44690:58"/>found my ſelf extream hungry, ſtepping then to the next Tree I faſtned my Engine and <hi>Ganſa</hi>'s thereto, and in great haſt fell to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining my Pockets for the Victuals I had reſerved there, but to my great ſurprize and vexation, inſtead of Partridges and Capons, which I thought I had hoarded there, I found nothing but a medley of dry leaves, Goats Hair, Sheep or Goats Dung, Moſs, and the like, my Canary-wine was turned, and ſtunk like Horſe-piſs; Oh the villany and cheats of theſe curſed Spirits, whoſe aſſiſtance if I had depended on, in what a condition had I been! while I ſtood muſing and wondring at this ſtrange Metamorphoſis, on a ſudden I heard my <hi>Ganſa</hi>'s fluttering behind me, and looking back, I ſpied them falling greedily upon a Shrub within the reach of their lines, whoſe leaves they fed earneſtly upon, whereas before I had never ſeen them eat any green thing whatever, therefore ſtepping to the Shrub, I put a leaf to my Mouth, the taſt whereof was ſo excellent, that I cannot expreſs it, and certainly if I had not with great diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moderated my Appetite, I ſhould have ſurfeited thereon, yet it happened to be a good bait both for me and my Birds, when we had moſt need of refreſhment.</p>
               <p>Scarce had we ended our Banquet, when I ſuddenly ſaw my ſelf ſurrounded with a ſtrange kind of People both in feature, manners, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44690:58"/>apparel, their Stature was very different, but they were generally twice as high as ours, their ſhape and countenance pleaſant, and their habit hardly to be deſcrib'd, for I never ſaw either Cloth, Silk, nor other Stuff, like that whereof their Cloths were made, neither, which is yet more ſtrange, can I poſſibly relate their colour, they being in a manner all cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alike; it was neither Black, White, Yellow, Red nor Blue, nor any colour compoſed of theſe; If you ask what was is then, I muſt tell you, it was a colour never ſeen in our Earthly World, and therefore neither to be deſcribed nor conceived by us, for as it is hard to make a man born blind underſtand the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Green and Blue, ſo neither can I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipher this Moon colour, as having no affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with any I ever beheld, I can only ſay it was the moſt glorious and delightful that can be imagined, neither was any thing more pleaſant to me during my ſtay there.</p>
               <p>Being ſurprized at the appearance of theſe People ſo ſuddenly and in ſuch accoutrements, I croſſed my ſelf and cry'd out, <hi>Jeſus Maria;</hi> No ſooner was the word <hi>Jeſus</hi> pronounced, but young and old fell all on their knees (whereat I not a little rejoiced) holding up both their hands on high, and repeating certain words which I underſtood not; And preſently riſing again, one much taller than the reſt came and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44690:59"/>kindly imbraced me, and ordering as I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſome of the reſt to attend my Birds, he took me by the hand, and led me to his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down toward the foot of the Hill, which was a building ſo great &amp; beautiful, as nothing in our World is comparable thereto; Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I ſaw ſuch as this ſeem'd but a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in reſpect of them; There was no Door about the Houſe leſs than thirty Foot high, and twelve broad, the Rooms were forty or fifty Foot in height, and anſwerable in proportion, neither could they be much leſs, the Maſter thereof being full twenty eight high, and I ſuppoſe his Body would weigh twenty five or thirty of ours; After I had reſted with him about one of our days, he led me five Leagues off to the Palace of the Prince of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the ſtatelineſs whereof I have not now leiſure to deſcribe; This Prince was much taller than the former, and called (as neer as I can by letters declare it, for their ſounds are not perfectly to be expreſt by our Characters,) <hi>Pylonas</hi> which in their Language is <hi>Firſt</hi> or <hi>Chief,</hi> if it doth not rather denote his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Dignity, as being the principal man in all thoſe parts; Though yet there is one Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Monarch amongſt them, much greater of ſtature than he, commanding over all that whole World, having under him twenty nine other Princes of very great Power, and every one of theſe has twenty four Inferior Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44690:59"/>whereof this <hi>Pylonas</hi> was one. The firſt Anceſtor of this great Monarch came out of the Earth, as they relate, and by marrying the Hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs of that vaſt Monarchy obtaining the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, left it to his Poſterity, who have enjoyed it ever ſince, even forty thouſand Moons, which is 3077 years; His name was <hi>Irdonozur</hi> whoſe Heirs to this day aſſume the ſame name, he, they ſay, having continued there about four hundred Moons, and begot divers Children, return'd (though by what means they know not) to the Earth again. I doubt they have their fables as well as we, ſince our Hiſtorians never mention any Earthly Man to have been in that World before my ſelf, and much leſs to have return'd again, I cannot therefore but condemn this tradition as falſe and Romantick, though I found Learning was in great eſteem among them, and they ſeem to deteſt Lying and Falſhood which is there ſeverely puniſhed, and which may yield ſome credit to their Hiſtorical Narrations. Many of them live wonderful long, even beyond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, affirming to me that ſome ſurvived thirty thouſand Moons, which is above a thouſand years, ſo that the Ages of three or four men might eaſily reach to the time of the firſt <hi>Irdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nozur,</hi> and this is generally noted that the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler people are of Stature, the more excellent are their endowments of mind, and the longer time they live; for their ſtature is very different,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44690:60"/>great numbers not much exceeding ours, who ſeldom live above a thouſand Moons, which is fourſcore of our years, theſe they account very baſe, unworthy creatures, but one degree above brute Beaſts, and accordingly imploy in the moſt mean and Servile Offices, calling them Baſtards, Counterfeits or Changlings; Thoſe whom they account true <hi>Natural Lunars</hi> or <hi>Moon Men,</hi> exceed ours generally thirty times, both in quantity of Body, and length of life, proportionable to the quality of the day in both Worlds, theirs containing almoſt thirty of our days.</p>
               <p>The manner of our travel to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Pylonas</hi> was more ſtrange and incre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dible than any thing we have related, for at our firſt ſetting forth there were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to each of us two Feather Fans like thoſe our Ladies in <hi>Spain</hi> cool themſelves with in Summer; You muſt underſtand that the Globe or the Moon has likewiſe an attractive power, yet ſo much weaker than the Earth, that if a man do but ſpring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with all his ſtrength, as Dancers do in ſhewing their Tricks, he will be able to mount fifty or ſixty foot high, and being then above all attraction from the Moons Earth, he falls down no more, but by the help of theſe Fans as with Wings, they convey themſelves in the Air in a ſhort ſpace, (though not quite ſo ſwift as Birds) whither they pleaſe. In two
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44690:60"/>hours time (as I could gueſs) by the help of theſe Fans we were carried through the Air thoſe five Leagues, in all about ſixty Perſons. Being arrived at the Palace of <hi>Pylonas,</hi> after our Conductor had got Audience, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what manner of Preſent he had brought, I was immediately called in to him by his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants; By the Statelineſs of his Palace and the reverence done him, I ſoon perceived his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore managed my affairs in order to procure his favour accordingly, and having, as you may remember, a certain little Box or Casket of Jewels, the remainder of thoſe I brought from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> before I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced I ſecretly took them out of my pocket, and chuſing ſome of each ſort, I made them ready to be preſented as I ſhould think conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>I found him ſitting in a moſt magnificent Chair of State with his Wife or Queen on one hand, and his Eldeſt Son on the other, one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a Troop of Ladies, and the other of young men, and all along the ſide of the Room ſtood a great number of handſom Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, whereof ſcarce one was lower of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture than <hi>Pylonas,</hi> whoſe Age they report is now one and twenty thouſand Moons. At my entrance I fell on my knees, and though fit to addreſs to him with theſe words in Latin, <hi>Propitius ſit tibi Princeps Illuſtriſſime Dominus Noſter Jeſus Chriſtus,</hi> &amp;c. As the former Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44690:61"/>ſo theſe hearing the holy name of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, the King, Queen, and all the reſt kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pronouncing a word or two, I underſtood not, being riſe again, I proceeded. <hi>Et Maria, Salvatoris Genetrix Petrus &amp; Paulus,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo reckoning up a number of Saints to find if they honoured any of them as their Patron, at laſt naming among many other St. <hi>Martinus</hi> they all bowed their heads and held up their hands in ſign of great reverence, the reaſon whereof I found was, that <hi>Martin</hi> in their Language ſignifies God. Then taking out my Jewels, I preſented to the King ſeven Stones of ſeveral ſorts, a Diamond, a Ruby, an Emerald, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phire, a Topaz and an Opal, which he accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Joy and admiration, as having ſeldom ſeen the like; Then I offered the Queen and Prince ſome others, and deſign'd to have beſtow'd divers more upon his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, but <hi>Pylonas</hi> forbid them to accept any, ſuppoſing, as I heard, they were all I had, which he would have me reſerve for <hi>Irdonozur</hi> his Soveraign; He then imbraced me with much indearedneſs, &amp; inquired divers things by ſigns, which I anſwered in the ſame manner to the beſt of my Skill, which not contenting him, he delivered me to the guard of 100 of his Giants as I may well call them, ſtrictly charging them that I ſhould want nothing fit for me; That they ſhould ſuffer none of the <hi>Dwarf Lunars</hi> or <hi>little Moon Men,</hi> if I may ſo term them, to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44690:61"/>come near me. That I ſhould with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be inſtructed in their Language, and laſtly that they ſhould by no means impart to me the knowledge of ſeveral things by him Specified, what they were I could never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. It may be you long to know what <hi>Pylonas</hi> inquired of me; Why what ſhould it be but, whence I came, how I arrived there, what was my name and buſineſs, with the like, to all which I anſwered as near the truth as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.</p>
               <p>Being diſmiſt I was provided with all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries as my heart could wiſh, ſo that I ſeem'd to be in a Paradiſe, the pleaſures where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of did not yet ſo tranſport me, but I was much concerned with the thoughts of my Wife and Children, and therefore ſtill retaining ſome Sparks of Hope that I might again return to them I tended my <hi>Ganſa's</hi> dayly with much care, which yet had ſignified little if other men had not done more than I could; For now the time came when of neceſſity all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Stature, and my ſelf likewiſe, muſt needs ſleep thirteen or fourteen whole days together, for by a ſecret and irreſiſtible decree of nature when the day begins to appear, and the Moon to be enlightned by the Sun Beams which is in the firſt Quarter of the Moon, all people of our ſtature inhabiting theſe parts fall into a dead ſleep, and are not poſſibly to be wakened till the Sun ſet, and is withdrawn, for as Owls
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44690:62"/>and Bats with us cannot indure the light, ſo at the firſt approach of day we begin to be amazed therewith, and fall immediately into a ſlumber, which grows by degrees into a dead ſleep till the light be gone, which is in fourteen or fifteen days, that is till the laſt Quarter.</p>
               <p>Some will be apt to wonder what light there is in that World during the Suns abſence, to them I declare that there is a two fold light, one of the Sun which I could not endure to behold, and another of the Earth; Now that of the Earth was at the height, for when the Moon is at the change, then is the Earth a full Moon to them, and as the Moon increaſeth with us, ſo the light of the Earth decreaſeth with them. I then found the light there, though the Sun was abſent, equal to that with us in the day when the Sun is clouded, but toward the quarter it dayly diminiſheth, yet leaving ſtill a competent light, which ſeems very ſtrange, though not ſo remarkable as what they there report, that in the other Hemiſphere of the Moon, contrary to that I fell upon, where dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half the Moon they ſee not the Sun, and the Earth never appears to them, they have notwithſtanding a kind of light not unlike our Moon light, which it ſeems the neerneſs of the Stars and other Planets that are at a far leſs diſtance than from us, affords them.</p>
               <p>You muſt underſtand that of the <hi>true Lunars</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:44690:62"/>of <hi>Moon men</hi> there are three kinds, ſome a little taller than we, as perhaps ten or twelve Foot high, theſe can indure the day of the Moon, when the Earth ſhines but little, but not the Beams of both, and therefore muſt then be laid aſleep; Others are twenty Foot high or above, who can ſuffer all the light both of the Earth and Sun. There are in a certain Iſland (the myſteries where of are carefully concealed) men whoſe Stature is at leaſt twenty ſeven Foot high of the meaſure of <hi>Spain;</hi> If any other come a land there in the Moons day time, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fall aſleep; This is called <hi>Inſula Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini,</hi> or Gods Iſland, and hath a particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who as they report is ſixty five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Moons old, which makes five thouſand of our years, his name is ſaid to be <hi>Hiruch,</hi> and he in a manner commands <hi>Irdonozur</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, eſpecially in that Iſland out of which he never removes; There is another likewiſe comes often thither, who they ſay is not above half his Age, that is about thirty three thouſand Moons, or two thouſand ſix hundred of our years, and he orders all things throughout the whole Globe of the Moon in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the Service of God, as abſolutely as our holy Father the Pope doth in any part of <hi>Italy,</hi> I would fain have ſeen this man, but was not permitted to come near him, his name is <hi>Imazes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let me ſettle my ſelf to a long nights
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44690:63"/>ſleep, to which end my Attendants take charge of my Birds, prepare my lodging, and ſignifie to me by ſigns how I muſt order my ſelf. It was then about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> when I perceived the Air more clear than ordinary, and with the increaſe of the light I began to feel my ſelf firſt dull and then heavy to ſleep, though I had not been lately diſturb'd of my reſt; At length I delivered my ſelf into the cuſtody of this Siſter of Death, whoſe Priſoner I was for almoſt a Fortnight after, and then awaking, it is not to be believed how freſh, brisk and vigorous I found the faculties both of my Body and Mind; I then immediately applyed my ſelf to learning the Language, which is the very ſame throughout all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Moon, yet not ſo wonderful, ſince I believe all the Earth of Moon does not amount to the fortieth part of our inhabited Earth, partly becauſe the Globe of the Moon is far leſs than that of the Earth, and beſides the Sea or Ocean covers very nigh three parts of four, whereas the Land and Sea in out World may be judged of an equal meaſure. Their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is very difficult, ſince it hath no Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with any other I ever heard, and conſiſts not ſo much of Words and Letters as Tunes and ſtrange ſounds which no Letters can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, for there are few words but ſignifie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and ſeveral things, and are diſtinguiſhed only by their Sounds, which are ſung as it were
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44690:63"/>in uttering yea many words conſiſt of tunes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without words; By occaſion whereof I find a Language may be framed, and eaſily learned, as copious as any other in the World only of Tunes which is an Experiment worth ſearching after; Notwithſtanding theſe difficulties within two months I attained to ſuch knowledge therein that I underſtood moſt Queſtions demanded of me, and with ſigns and words made reaſonable ſhift to utter my mind, which <hi>Pylonas</hi> having notice of, he oftimes ſent for me, and was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inform me of many things my Guardians durſt not diſcloſe, though I muſt needs ſay I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found they abuſed me with an untruth, but if I asked a queſtion they were unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, they would ſhake their heads, and with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> ſhrug divert to ſome other diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>After ſeven Months time it happened the great <hi>Irdonozur</hi> making his Progreſs to a place about two hundred Leagues from the Palace of <hi>Pylonas,</hi> ſent for me, yet would not admit me into his preſence but diſcourſt me through a Window where I might hear him, and he hear and ſee me at pleaſure. I preſented him the remainder of my Jewels which he very thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accepted, ſaying he would requited them with gifts of a far more conſiderable value. I ſtay'd there not above a quarter of a Moon when I was again ſent back to <hi>Pylonas,</hi> for if we had ſtay'd a day or two longer the Sun would have overtaken us before we could have
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44690:64"/>recovered our home. The gifts he beſtowed on me were ſuch that a man would part with Mountains of Gold to purchaſe, they were all Stones nine only in number, of three ſorts, one called <hi>Poleaſtis,</hi> another <hi>Machrus,</hi> and the third <hi>Ebelus,</hi> of each ſort 3. the firſt are about the bigneſs of an Hazel-nut very like Jet, which among many other incredible Virtues hath this property, that being once put in the Fire they ever after retain their heat, though with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any outward appearance, till quenched with ſome kind of liquor which no way endamages them though heated and cooled therein a thouſand times; Their heat is ſo vehement that it will make any Metal within a foot of it red hot, and being in a Chimney warms the Room as if a great fire were kindled therein. The <hi>Machrus</hi> is yet more precious, in colour like a <hi>Topaz,</hi> ſo clear and reſplendent as though not above the bigneſs of a Bean, yet being placed in the night in the midſt of a large Church it makes all as light as if an hundred Lamps were hanged round; can any man wiſh for more uſeful properties in a Stone than theſe? Yet my <hi>Ebelus</hi> is ſo excellent that it may be much prefer'd before them, yea prized above all the Diamonds, Saphires, Rubies, and Emeralds that our World can afford. The <hi>Lunar</hi> colour is ſo exceeding beautiful that a man would travel a thouſand Leagues to behold it, the Shape is ſomewhat flat, of the breadth of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44690:64"/>a peice of Eight, and twice the thickneſs, one ſide is of a more Orient colour than the other, which being clapt to a mans bare Skin, takes away all the weight and ponderouſneſs of his Body, but turning the other ſide, it adds force to the attractive beams of the Earth either in this World or that, and makes the body half as heavy again; Do you wonder now why I ſhould ſo overprize this ſtone? before you ſee me on Earth again, you will find I have reaſon to value this invaluable Jewel. I inquired whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had not any kind of Jem, or other means to make a man inviſible, which I judged a thing of admirable uſe, and could mention divers of our learned men who had written to this purpoſe; They anſwered, that if it were poſſible, yet they were ſure Heaven would not ſuffer it to be revealed to us creatures ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſo many imperfections, and which might be eaſily abuſed to ill purpoſes, and this was all I could get of them.</p>
               <p>Now after it was know that <hi>Irdonozur</hi> the great Monarch had done me this honour, it is ſtrange how much all reſpected me more than before; my Guardians who had been hitherto cautious in relating any thing of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that World, grew now more open, ſo that from them and <hi>Pylonas</hi> together I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood many notable particulars; As that in a thouſand years there is found neither Thief nor Whore-Monger, for firſt there is no want
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44690:65"/>of any thing neceſſary for the uſe of man, food growing every where without labour of all ſorts that can be deſired. As for Cloths, Houſes or whatever elſe a man may be ſuppos'd to want, it is provided by their Superiors, though not without ſome labour, but yet ſo eaſy as if they did it for pleaſure; Again their Females are all abſolute Beauties, and by a ſecret diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of nature, a man there having once known a Woman never deſires any other; Murther was never heard of amongſt them, neither is it hardly poſſible to be committed, for there can be no wound made but what is cureable, yea they aſſured me, and for my part I believe it, that though a mans head be cut off, yet if within three Moons it be joined to the Carcaſs again, and the Juice of a certain Herb there growing applyed, it will be ſo conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated as the wounded party ſhall in a few hours be perfectly cured. But the chief cauſe of their good government is an excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the nature of the People, ſo that all both Old and Young hate all manner of vice and live in ſuch love, peace, and amity as it ſeems to be another Paradiſe; Though it is true likewiſe that ſome are of a better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition than others, which they diſcern immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately at their Birth; And becauſe it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable Law amongſt them that none ſhall be put to death, therefore perceiving by their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or ſome other ſigns who are like to be of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44690:65"/>a wicked and debauched humor, they ſend them, I know not by what means, into the Earth, and change them for other Children, before they have either opportunity or ability to do amiſs among them, but firſt, they ſay, they are fain to keep them there for ſome time till the Air of the Earth alters their colour like ours. Their ordinary vent for them is a certain high Hill in the North of <hi>America,</hi> whoſe people, I am apt to believe, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcended from them, both in regard of their colour, and their continual uſe of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, which the <hi>Lunars</hi> or <hi>Moon Men</hi> ſmoak exceedingly, the place abounding much with moiſture, together with the pleaſure they take therein, and ſome other reſpects too long to rehearſe: Sometimes, though but ſeldom, they miſtake their aim and fall upon <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> or <hi>Africa.</hi> I remember ſome years ſince I read certain ſtories tending to confirm what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by theſe <hi>Lunars,</hi> and eſpeciaily one Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Neubrigenſis, de rebus Angl.</hi> It is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the end of the firſt book, the Chapter I have forgot: <hi>Inigo Mondejar</hi> in his diſcription of <hi>Nova Granata</hi> Book 2. Alſo <hi>Joſeph Defia de Carana</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Mexico</hi> if my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fail not, recount what will make my report much more credible; but I value not teſtimonies.</p>
               <p>If you inquire farther of the government of the <hi>Lunars,</hi> and how Juſtice is executed, alas what need is there of exemplary puniſhment
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44690:66"/>where no offences are committed, neither need they any Lawyers, for there is no contention, the ſeeds whereof when they begin to ſprout are inſtantly by the wiſdom of the next Superior pluckt up by the Roots. And as little want is there of Phyſicians, they never ſurfeit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Air is always pure and temperate, neither is there any cauſe at all of ſickneſs, I could never hear of any that were diſtempered. But the time aſſign'd them by nature being ſpent, they dye without the leaſt pain, or as I ſhould rather ſay, they ceaſe to live, as a Candle does to give light when what nouriſhes it is conſumed. I was once at the departure of one of them, and was much ſurprized that notwithſtanding the happy life he liv'd, and the multitude of Friends and Children he ſhould forſake, yet as ſoon as he certainly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood his end to approach, he prepar'd a great Feaſt, and inviting all whom he eſpecially eſteem'd, he exhorts them, <hi>To be merry and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with him, ſince the time was come he ſhould now leave the counterfeit Pleaſures of that World, and be made partaker of all true Joy and perfect happineſs;</hi> I did not ſo much admire his own conſtancy as the behaviour of his Friends; With us in the like caſe all ſeem to mourn, when many of them do oft but laugh in their Sleeves, or under a Vizard. But here all both young and old did, in my conſcience, not pretendedly but really rejoyce thereat, and if any diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44690:66"/>it was only grief for their own particular loſs. Being dead their Bodies putrify not, and therefore are not buried, but kept in certain Rooms appointed to that purpoſe, ſo that moſt of them can ſhew their Anceſtors Bodies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt for many Generations; There is never any Rain, Wind, or change of Weather, never either Summer or Winter, but as it were a perpetual Spring, yielding all pleaſure and content, free from the leaſt trouble or annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; O my Wife and Children what wrong have you done me to bereave me of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of that place! But it is no great matter, for by this Voyage I am ſufficiently aſſured, that when the race of my mortal life is run I ſhall attain a greater and everlaſting happineſs elſewhere.</p>
               <p>It was the ninth of <hi>September</hi> that I began to aſcend from the <hi>Pike of Tenariff,</hi> twelve days I was upon my Voyage and Arrived in that Province of the Moon called <hi>Simiri Sept.</hi> 21. following <hi>Friday May</hi> the twelft we came to the Court of the great <hi>Irdonozur</hi> and return'd back the ſeventeenth to the Palace of <hi>Pylonas</hi> where I continued till <hi>March</hi> 1601. When I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requeſted <hi>Pylonas,</hi> as I had oft done before to give me leave to depart, though with never ſo great hazard of my life, back into the Earth again. He much diſſuaded me, inſiſting on the danger of the Voyage, the miſery of that place from whence I came, and the abundant happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44690:67"/>I now enjoy'd, but the remembrance of my Wife and Children outweigh'd all theſe reaſons, and to ſay the truth, I was ſo elated with a deſire of the deſerved glory I ſhould purchaſe at my return, as methought I deſerved not the name of a <hi>Spaniard</hi> if I would not hazard twenty lives rather than loſe the leaſt particle thereof. I therefore replyed, that I had ſo ſtrong a deſire to ſee my Children as I found I could not poſſibly live any longer without going to them; He then requeſted me to ſtay one year longer, I told him, I muſt needs depart now or never, my Birds began to droop for want of their uſual Voyage, three were already dead, and if a few more failed I was forever deſtitute of all poſſibility of return. At length with much ſolliciting I prevail'd, having firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the great <hi>Irdonozur</hi> with my Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and perceiving by the often baying of my Birds a great longing in them to be gone, I trim'd up my Engine, and took my leave of <hi>Pylonas,</hi> who for all the kindneſs he had ſhewn me required but one thing of me which was to promiſe him faithfully that if ever I had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity I would ſalute from him <hi>Elizabeth</hi> whom he term'd, <hi>The great Queen</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> calling her the moſt glorious of all Women liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and indeed he would often queſtion me about her, wherein he ſo much delighted that he ſeem'd never ſatisfied with talking of her, he likewiſe delivered me a Preſent for her
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44690:67"/>of no ſmall value, and though I account her an Enemy to <hi>Spain,</hi> yet will I not fail in performing this promiſe as ſoon as I am able</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday March</hi> 29. Three days after my waking from the laſt Moons light I faſtened my ſelf to my Engine, not forgetting to take the Jewels <hi>Irdonozur</hi> had given me, with the Virtues and uſe whereof <hi>Pylonas</hi> had aaquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me at large, together with a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Victuals whereof afterward I had great occaſion. A vaſt multitude of People being preſent and among them <hi>Pylonas</hi> himſelf, after I had given them all the laſt Farewel, I let looſe the reins to my Birds, who with much greedineſs taking wing, quickly carried me out of ſight, it happened to me as in my firſt Paſſage, for I never felt either hunger or thirſt till I fell upon an high Mountain in <hi>China</hi> about five Leagues from the High and Mighty City of <hi>Pequin.</hi> This Voyage was performed in leſs then nine days, neither heard I any news of theſe Airy men I met with in my aſcending, nothing ſtay'd me in the leaſt in my Journey, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe of the earneſt deſire of my Birds to return to the Earth, having already miſſed their ſeaſon, or that the attraction of the Earth was ſo much ſtronger than that of the Moon, and ſo made it eaſier, yet ſo it was though I had three Birds leſs than before. For the firſt eight days my Birds flew before me, and I on the Engine was as it were drawn after, but the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44690:68"/>ninth day, when I began to approach the Clouds, I perceived my ſelf and Engine to ſink toward the Earth, and go before them. I was then horribly afraid leaſt my Birds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bear our weight, being ſo few, ſhould be conſtrained to precipitate both me and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves headlong to the Earth, and therefore thought it very neceſſary to make uſe of my ſtone <hi>Ebelus</hi> which I clapt to my bare Skin within my Cloths, and inſtantly I perceiv'd my Birds made way with greater eaſe than before, as ſeeming freed from a great burthen, neither do I think they could poſſibly have let me down ſafely to the Earth without that help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>China</hi> is a Countrey ſo populous that I think there is ſcarce a piece of ground thrice a mans length which is not carefully manured; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet in the Air ſome of the Countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpying me came running by Troops, and ſeizing me would needs carry me before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, and ſeeing no other remedy I yielded to them. But when I try'd to go I found my ſelf ſo light that one foot being on the ground I had much ado to ſet down the other, which was by reaſon my <hi>Ebelus</hi> ſo applyed took all weight away from my Body, therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what to do, I pretended a deſire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the neceſſities of nature, which being made known to them by ſigns, for they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not a word of any Language I could ſpeak, they permitted me to go aſide among a
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44690:68"/>few buſhes, aſſuring themſelves it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble I ſhould eſcape from them; being there, I remembred <hi>Pylonas</hi> his directions about the uſe of my ſtones, and knit them up, (together with a few remaining Jewels I brought from <hi>Judea</hi>) into an handkerchief, all except the leaſt and worſt <hi>Ebelus,</hi> which I found means to apply in ſuch manner to my body that but the half of its ſide touched my Skin, this done I drew toward my Guardians, till coming ſo neer that they could not croſs my way, I ſhewed them a fair pair of heels, that I might have time to hide my Jewels which I knew they would have rob'd me of if not prevented. Being thus lightned I led them ſuch a dance, that had they been all upon the backs of ſo many Race Horſes they could never have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken me; I directed my Courſe to a thick Wood, wherein I entred about a quarter of a League and there finding a fine Spring, which I took for my mark, I thurſt my Jewels into a hole made by a Mole hard by.</p>
               <p>I then took my Victuals out of my pocket, to which till now in all my Voyage I had not the leaſt appetite, and refreſhed my ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, till the people who perſued overtook me, into whoſe hands I quietly ſurrendred my ſelf; They led me to an inferior Officer, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that I eſcap't from thoſe who firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended me, cauſed an incloſure of boards to be made, wherein they put me, ſo that only
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44690:69"/>my head was at liberty, and then carried me upon the Shoulders of four ſlaves, like ſome notorious Malefactor, before a Perſon of great Authority, who in their Language I learnt, was called a <hi>Mandarin,</hi> and reſided a League off the famous City of <hi>Pequin.</hi> I could not underſtand them, but found I was accuſed for ſomething with much vehemence, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this accuſation it ſeems was, that I was a Magician as appeared by my being ſo ſtrangely carried in the Air, and that being a ſtranger as both my Language and habit did declare, I contrary to the Laws of <hi>China</hi> had entred the Kingdom without a Warrant, and probably for no good intent. The <hi>Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin</hi> heard them with a great deal of compoſed gravity, and being a man of quick apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſtudious of Novelties, he told them he would take ſuch order as the caſe required, and my bold attempt ſhould not go unpuniſhed; Having diſmiſt them he ordered his Servants I ſhould be kept in a remote part of his vaſt Pallace, be ſtrictly guarded, and kindly uſed; This I conjecture by my treatment and what followed, for my accommodation was much better than I could expect, I lodg'd well, eat well, was well attended, and could complain of nothing but my reſtraint; Thus continued I many months, afflicted more with the thoughts of my <hi>Ganſa's</hi> than any thing elſe, who I knew muſt be irrecoverably loſt, as indeed they were.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:44690:69"/>
               <p>In this time by my own Induſtry, and the aſſiſtance of thoſe who accompanied me, I learnt to ſpeak indifferently the ordinary Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that Province, (for almoſt every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in <hi>China</hi> hath its proper Tongue) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at I perceived they were much pleaſed; At length I was permitted to take the Air, and brought into the ſpacious Garden of that Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, a place of extraordinary pleaſure and delight, adorned with Herbs and Flowers of admirable ſweetneſs and beauty, with almoſt infinite variety of Fruits, <hi>European</hi> and others, all compoſed with that rare curioſity as even raviſhed my ſenſes in the contemplation of ſuch delightful objects; I had not long recreated my ſelf here, when the <hi>Mandarin</hi> entred the Garden on that ſide I was walking, of which having notice by his Servants, and that I ought to kneel to him (a uſual reverence I found toward great Officers) I did ſo, and humbly intreated his favour toward a poor ſtranger who arrived in theſe parts not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly but by the ſecret diſpoſal of the Heavens; He anſwered in a different Language which I hear all the <hi>Mandarins</hi> uſe, and like that of the <hi>Lunars</hi> conſiſting chiefly of tunes, which was interpreted by one of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, wiſhing me to be of good comfort ſince he intended no harm to me, and ſo paſſed on. Next day I was ordered to come before him, and being conducted into a Noble dining
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44690:70"/>Room exquiſitely painted and imbelliſhed, the <hi>Mandarin</hi> commanding all to avoid, vouchſafed to confer with me in the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Langaage, inquiring into the ſtate of my Countrey, the Power of my Prince, and the Religion and Manners of the People, wherein having ſatisfied him, he deſcended to ask me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my education and ſtudies, and what brought me into this remote Countrey; I then at large declared to him the Adventures of my Life, only omitting what parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars I thought convenient, and eſpecially for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to mention the Stones given me by <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozur,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtrangeneſs of my ſtory did much amaze him, and finding in all my diſcourſe nothing tending to Magick, wherein he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by my means to be inſtructed, he began to admire the excellency of my Wit, applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me for the happieſt man that this World ever ſaw, and wiſhing me to repoſe my ſelf after my long Narration, he for that time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed me. After which the <hi>Mandarin</hi> took ſo much delight in me, that no day paſſed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he did not ſend for me; At length he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed me to cloth my ſelf in the habit of that Countrey, which I willingly did, and gave me not only the liberty of his Houſe, but took me alſo with him when he went to <hi>Pequin,</hi> whereby I had opportunity by degrees to learn the diſpoſition of the People, and the Policy of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44690:70"/>the Countrey, neither did I by my attendance on him, gain only the knowledge of theſe things, but the poſſibility likewiſe of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to my native Soil, and to thoſe dear Pledges which I value above the World, even my Wife and Children; For by often fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting <hi>Pequin,</hi> I at length heard of ſome Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Society of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who were become famous for the extraordinary favour afforded them by the King, to whom they had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſome <hi>European</hi> Rarities, as Clocks, Watches, Dials, and the like, which by them were accounted exquiſite Curioſities. To theſe by the <hi>Mandarins</hi> leave I repaired, and was welcomed by them, they much wondring to ſee a Lay <hi>Spaniard</hi> there, whither they had with ſo much difficulty obtained leave to arrive. There did I relate to Father <hi>Pantoja</hi> &amp; others of the Society the foremention'd adventures, by whoſe directions I put them in writing, and ſent this ſtory of my Fortunes to <hi>Macao,</hi> from thence to be conveyed to <hi>Spain</hi> as a forerunner of my return; And the <hi>Mandarin</hi> being very indulgent to me, I came often to the Fathers with whom I conſulted about many ſecrets, and with them alſo laid the Foundation of my return, the bleſſed hour whereof I do with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience expect, that by inriching my Countrey with the knowledge of theſe hidden myſteries, I may at laſt reap the Glory of my Forrunate Misfortunes.</p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:44690:71"/>
               <p>Mention being made in the preceding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Pike of Teneriff</hi> one of the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands, which is thought not to have its equal in the World for height, its top being ſo much above the Clouds, that in clear weather it may be ſeen ſixty <hi>Dutch</hi> Leagues at Sea, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it altogether unpleaſant to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> men who a few years ſince aſcended to the top thereof, and Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fellowing relation.</p>
               <p>It cannot be aſcended but in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> lying all the other months covered with Snow, though upon this and the near adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Iſlands none is to be ſeen; It requires three days travel to come to the top; The Merchants and other worthy Perſons who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this Journey proceed thus. Having furniſht our ſelves with a Guide, Servants, and Horſes to carry our Wine and Proviſion, we ſet forth from <hi>Oratava</hi> a Port Town in the Iſland of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> ſcituate on the north ſide, two mile diſtant from the main Sea, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd from twelve at night till eight in the morning, by which time we got to the top of the firſt Mountain toward the <hi>Pico de Terraira,</hi> there under a very large and conſpicuous Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree we took our Breakfaſt, Din'd, and refreſht our ſelves till two in the Aſternoon. Then we paſſed through many ſandy ways, over many lofty Mountains, but naked and bare, and not covered with Pine Trees as our firſt nights
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44690:71"/>paſſage was; this expoſed us to exceſſive heat, till we arrived to the foot of the <hi>Pico,</hi> where we found divers huge Stones which ſeemed to have fallen from ſome upper part; About ſix in the evening we began to aſcend up the <hi>Pice,</hi> but were ſcarce advanced a mile, and the way being no more paſſible for Horſes, we left them with our Servants. In the aſcent of one mile, ſome of our Company grew very faint and ſick, diſordered by Fluxes, Vomitings, and Aguiſh Diſtempers, our Horſes hair ſtanding up like Briſtles, and calling for ſome of our Wine carried in ſmall Barrels on an Horſe, we found it ſo wonderfully cold, that we could not drink it till we had made a Fire to warm it, notwithſtanding the Air was very calm and moderate, but when the Sun was ſet, it began to blow with ſuch violence, and grow ſo cold, that taking up our lodging among the hollow Rocks, we were neceſſitated to keep Fires in the mouths of them all night.</p>
               <p>About four in the morning we began to mount again, and being come another mile up, one of our Company fail'd and was able to proceed no further; Here began the <hi>black Rocks,</hi> the reſt of us purſued our Journey till we came to the <hi>Sugar Loaf,</hi> where we began to travel again in a white Sand, being fitted with Shoes, whoſe ſingle Soles are made a Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger broader than the upper Leathers, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter this difficult paſſage; Having aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44690:72"/>as far as the <hi>black Rocks,</hi> which lay all flat like a plain Floor, we climbed within a mile of the very top of the <hi>Pico,</hi> and at laſt we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the <hi>Summit,</hi> where we found no ſuch ſmoke as appeared a little below, but a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual perſpiration of a hot and ſulphurous va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour that made our Faces extreamly ſore, all this way we found no conſiderable alteration of the Air, and very little Wind, but on the top it was ſo impetuous that we had much ado to ſtand againſt it whilſt we drank the Kings Health, and fired each of us a Piece. Here alſo we took our Dinner, but found that our ſtrong Waters had loſt their vertue, and were almoſt inſipid, while our Wine was more Brisk and Spirituous than before; The top on which we ſtood being not above a yard broad is the Brink of a Pit called the <hi>Caldera</hi> which we judged to be a Musket ſhot over, and near four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yards deep in form of a Cone, hollow within like a Kettel, and covered over with ſmall looſe ſtones mixed with Sulphur and Sand, from among which iſſued divers Spira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Smaok and Heat, which being ſtirred with any thing puffs and makes a noiſe, and ſo offenſive, that we were even ſuffocated with the ſudden riſing of Vapors upon removing one of theſe Stones, which were ſo hot as not eaſily to be handled; We deſcended not above four or five yards into the <hi>Caldera</hi> or Caldron becauſe of the Slipperineſs under foot,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44690:72"/>and the difficulty, but ſome have adventured to the bottom; Other matters obſervable we diſcovered none beſides a clear ſort of <hi>Sulphur</hi> which lay like Salt upon the Stones; From this renowned <hi>Pico</hi> we could ſee the <hi>Grand Canaries</hi> fourteen Leagues diſtant, <hi>Palma</hi> eighteen, and <hi>Gomera</hi> ſeven, which interval of Sea ſeemed not much wider than the <hi>Thames</hi> about <hi>London;</hi> We diſcerned alſo the <hi>Herro</hi> being diſtant about twenty Leagues, and ſo to the outmoſt limits of the Sea much farther; As ſoon as the Sun appeared the ſhadow of the <hi>Pico</hi> ſeem'd to cover not only the whole Iſland and the <hi>Grand Canaries</hi> but the Sea to the very Horizon, where the top of the Sugar-loaf or <hi>Pico</hi> viſibly appeared to turn up, and caſt its ſhade into the Air it ſelf, at which we were much ſurprized;</p>
               <p>But the Sun was not far aſcended when the Clouds began to riſe ſo faſt, as intercepted our Proſpect both of the Sea and the whole Iſland, except the tops only of the Subjacent Mountains which ſeemed to pierce them through, whether theſe Clouds do ever ſurmount the <hi>Pico</hi> we cannot ſay, but to ſuch as are far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low they ſeem ſometimes to hang above it, or rather wrap themſelves about it, as conſtantly when the Weſt Winds blow, this they call the Cap, and is an infallible prognoſtick of enſuing Storms; One of our Company who made this Journey again two years after, arriving at the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44690:73"/>top of the <hi>Pico</hi> before day, and creeping under a great ſtone to Shrowd himſelf from the cold Air; after a little ſpace found himſelf all wet, and perceived it to come from a perpetual trickling of the Water from the Rocks above him; Many excellent and exuberant Springs we found iſſuing from the tops of moſt of the other mountains, guſhing out in great Spouts almoſt as far as the huge Pine-tree we men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before; Having ſtay'd a while at the top, we all deſcended the Sandy way till we came to the foot of the <hi>Sugar-loaf,</hi> which being ſteep even almoſt to a perpendicular we ſoon paſſed, and here we met with a Cave about ten yards deep and fifteen broad, being in ſhape like an Oven or <hi>Cupola,</hi> having a hole at the top near eight yards over; This we deſcended by a Rope that our Servants held faſt on the top, while with the other end being faſtned about our middles we ſwung our ſelves till being over a Bank of Snow, we ſlid down, lighting upon it, we were forced to ſwing thus in the deſcent, becauſe in the midſt of the bottom of this Cave oppoſite to the overture at the top is a round pit of Water like a Well, the ſurface whereof is about a yard lower, but as wide as the Mouth at top, and about ſix Fathom deep, we ſuppoſed this Water not a Spring, but diſſolved Snow blown in, or Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trickling through the Rocks; about the ſides of the Grott for ſome height there is
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:44690:73"/>Ice and Iſicles hanging down to the Snow.</p>
               <p>But being quickly weary of this exceſſive cold place, and drawn up again, we continued our deſcent from the Mountains by the ſame Paſſage we went up the day before, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five in the Evening arrived at <hi>Oratava</hi> from whence we ſet forth, our faces ſo red and ſore that to cool them we were forced to waſh and bath them in Whites of Eggs; The whole height of the <hi>Pico</hi> in perpendicular is vulgarly eſteemed to be two miles and an half. No Trees, Herbs nor Shrubs did we find in all the Paſſage, but Pines, and among the whiter Sands a kind of Broom being a buſhy Plant; It is the opinion of ſome Ingenious Perſons who have lived twenty years upon the place, that the whole Iſland being a Soil mightily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated with Brimſtone did in former times take fire and blow up all or near all at the ſame time, and that many Mountains of huge Stones calcined and burnt, which appears all over this Iſland, eſpecially in the South-Weſt part of it, were caſt up and raiſed out of the Bowels of the Earth at the time of that general conflragation, and that the greateſt quantity of this <hi>Sulphur</hi> lying about the center of the Iſland raiſed up the <hi>Pico</hi> to that height at which it now is ſeen, which appears by the ſcituation of thoſe Rocks that lye three or ſour Miles round the bottom of the <hi>Pico,</hi> and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44690:74"/>in ſuch order one above another almoſt to the <hi>Sugar-loaf</hi> as it is called, as if the whole ground ſwelling and riſing up together by the aſcenſion of the Brimſtone, the Torrents and Rivers of it did with a ſudden eruption Roul and Tumble them down from the reſt of the Rocks, eſpecially to the South-Weſt where from the top of the <hi>Pico</hi> to the Sea-coaſt lye huge heaps of theſe burnt Rocks one under another, and there ſtill remain the very tracks of the Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone Rivers as they ran over this Quarter of the Iſland which hath ſo waſted the ground, beyond recovery, that nothing can be made to grow there but Broom.</p>

               <p>This remoteſt part of <hi>Africa</hi> is very moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and overun with wild Beaſts, as Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tygers, Wolves, and many other Beaſts of Prey, which in the ſilent night diſcover themſelves by their noiſe and roaring; To the Teeth and Jaws of which cruel creatures the Natives do here expoſe their old people if death prevent not, when once they grow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit and troubleſom, laying them forth in ſome open place in the dark night, when the Wild Beaſts creep forth, and the young Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons roar after their Prey. One miſerable poor Old wretch was thus expoſed when ſome <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Ships were there, who by his pitiful cries was diſcovered by our Court of Guard that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44690:77"/>were there aſhoar not far from him by whom he was relieved and delivered for that preſent out of the Jaws of Death, and they asking <hi>Cooree</hi> one of the Natives (of whom hereafter) why they did ſo, he replied, <hi>It was their</hi> Cuſtom when their People had lived ſo long that they knew not what to do with them thus to be rid of them; They ſaw in this Bay of <hi>Souldania</hi> many Whales, and about the Shoar divers party-coloured Fowls and Oſtriches; The Soil about the Bay ſeems very good, but the Sun ſhines not upon a People in the whole World more Barbarous than thoſe which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it, being rather Beaſts in the Skins of men, than Men in the Skins of Beaſts, as appears by their Ignorance, Habit, Language, Diet and other things wherein they appear abſolutely brutiſh.</p>
               <p>For as to Religion, generally all the People in the World as well Heathen as Chriſtian do acknowledge the great God of Heaven and Earth, but they, as <hi>Cooree</hi> told us, own no God at all; Their ſpeech ſeems rather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulate noiſe than a Language, ſounding like the clucking of Hens, or Gabling of Turkies, wherewith as they walk about, they make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange confuſed noiſe, if there be two, three, five, ten, twenty or more in company it is their manner to walk in rank one after another in ſmall paths they have made by there going thus, as Cows in Summer do many times when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44690:77"/>they come home to the pail, or as Wild Geeſe who fly in Ranks, and as they fly make a noiſe, ſo theſe walking together gabble from the firſt to the laſt in company as if all ſpake and none anſwered; Their Habits are their Sheep-Skins undreſt thonged together, which cover their bodies to the middle, with a little flap of the ſame Skin tyed before them, being naked downward, when it is cold they put the Woolley, and when hot the Fleſhy ſide of thoſe Skins next their Body. Their Ornaments and Jewels are Bullocks or Sheepſguts full of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements about their Necks, and therefore when we bought their Cattel they would take, and we were content they ſhould, their Skins, Guts, and Garbage, which plentifully furniſh't them with that ſtinking attire; When they are hungry they ſit down upon ſome hillock, firſt ſhaking ſome of that filthy pudding out of the Guts about their Neck, then bowing down their Mouths to their hands almoſt as low as their knees, like hungry Dogs they gnaw and eat the Raw Guts, which you may conceive fills their Mouths full of ſweet Green Sauce.</p>
               <p>The Women are adorned, habited and dieted in the ſame manner, only they wear more about their lower parts than the men, they carry their ſucking Infants under their Skins upon their backs, and their Breaſts hanging down like Bagpipes, they put up with their hands to their Children that they may ſuck them over
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44690:78"/>their Shoulders; Both Sexes make coverings for their heads of Cow-dung and ſuch like ſilth, mingled with a little ſtinking Greaſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear their Faces with, which makes their Company inſufferable if they get the Wind of you; I obſerved (ſaith my Author) that ſome of the reſt of their Diet was agreeable to the former, for they would not refuſe any thing, as rotten and mouldy Biskets which we have given them, fit for nothing but the dunghill, yea they will devour what a hungry Dog in <hi>England</hi> would refuſe. I once obſerved a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of them, who had found on the Neighbour Shoar a large peice of a dead Fiſh the Sea had caſt up, which ſtunk intolerably, they made a little fire with dry Cow-dung wherewith they warm'd and then eat it, with as much appetite as an hungry man with us would feed upon a very choice and Savoury Diſh, which makes me apt to believe that theſe wretched creatures have but three ſenſes, wanting the benefit both of ſmelling and taſting. Theſe Brutes devote themſelves to Idleneſs, for they neither ſpin nor dig; They are very ſtreight and well limb'd, though not very Tall, their Faces very ill favoured, moſt of their Noſes flat, have little or no beard, the hair on their heads ſhort, black and curled, their Skins very tawny, ſwift they are of foot, and will throw Darts and ſhoot Arrows (which are their Weapons) very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly.</p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:44690:78"/>
               <p>I ſhall here inſert a true Relation (ſaith my Author) about three years before I went to <hi>India</hi> which was in 1615 one of the <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Companies Ships returning thence and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving at this Harbor, after a little ſtay when ſhe was ready to Sail, and having then two of theſe Salvages aboard, the Commander re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to bring them both home with him, imagining that having learnt <hi>Engliſh</hi> here, they might diſcover ſomething of their Countrey yet unknown to us; Theſe poor wretches thus ſurprized and carried away againſt their wills were much diſturbed; One of them meerly out of ſullenneſs, though he was very well uſed, died ſoon after they put to Sea; The other who called himſelf <hi>Cooree</hi> a forenamed, was brought to <hi>London,</hi> and there kept Six Months in Sir <hi>Thomas Smiths</hi> Houſe then Governor of the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company, where he had good Diet, good Cloths, good Lodging, and all other fitting Accommodations; One would have thought that this wretch might have conceived his preſent, compared with his former Condition a Heaven upon Earth.</p>
               <p>But all theſe things gave him no content, though to his good Entertainment he had gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry added, having a Chain of Bright Braſs, with Breaſt, Back and Headpeice of the ſame, and a Buckler all of Braſs his beloved Metal, yet all this did not now pleaſe him, for never did any man ſeem more weary of ill Uſage,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44690:79"/>than he was of Courteſies, none being ever more deſirous of returning to his Countrey than he; For when he had learn'd a little of our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he would dayly lye on the ground and cry out very often in broken <hi>Engliſh, Cooree home go, Souldania go, home go.</hi> And not long after when he had his deſire, and was return'd home, he had no ſooner ſet footing on his own ſhore but he preſently threw away his Cloths, his Linnen, with all his other covering, and inſtantly got his Sheep-Skins upon his back, guts about his Neck, and a perſum'd Cap of Cow-dung on his Head, and ſo returned <hi>like a Dog to his vomit, &amp; a Swine to his wallowing in the Mire,</hi> without a Metaphor; After this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was returned, it made the Natives very ſhy of us when we arrived there, for though they would come about us in great Companies when we firſt arrived, yet three or four days before they thought we would depart thence there was not one of them to be ſeen, fearing we would have dealt with them as formerly with <hi>Cooree.</hi> But it had been well he had never ſeen <hi>England,</hi> for as he diſcovered nothing to us, ſo certainly when he came home he told his Countreymen, having doubtleſs obſerv'd it here, that Braſs was but a baſe and cheap com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity in <hi>England,</hi> and it may be we had ſo well ſtored them with that Metal before, that we had never after ſuch a free exchange of our Braſs and Iron for their Cattel. It was
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44690:79"/>here that I asked <hi>Cooree,</hi> who was their God, He lifting up his hands anſwered in bad <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, England</hi> God, Great God; <hi>Souldania</hi> no God.</p>
               <p>In 1614. Ten <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> being condemned to dye for their ſeveral Crimes at the Seſſions in the <hi>Old Bayly London,</hi> had their Execution reſpited by the intreaty of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, upon condition they ſhould be all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to this place, that ſo if they could find any peaceble aboad here, they might diſcover ſomewhat advantagious to Trade, this was done accordingly, but two of them when they came thither were taken thence, and carried on the Voyage to the <hi>Indies;</hi> One named <hi>Daffeld</hi> was that year redeemed from this ſad baniſhment by Sir <hi>Thomas Row</hi> who was ſent Ambaſſador to the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> and afterward brought back to <hi>England</hi> by that Noble Gentleman, and being then intruſted by him, this ingrateful Villain ſtole ſome of his Plate and ran away; Another was likewiſe on the Voyage, but what became of him I know not. So that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained only eight, which were here left with Amunition and Victual, and a ſmall Boat to carry them to and from a very little uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Iſland, lying in the very Mouth of the Bay of <hi>Souldania,</hi> as a place for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and ſafety from the Natives on the Main; It is called <hi>Penguin</hi> Iſland, probably ſo named by ſome <hi>Welſhman,</hi> in whoſe Language <hi>Penguin</hi>

               <p>The Chief Perſon left here was one <hi>Croſs,</hi> who call'd himſelf Captain; He was before one of the Yeomen of the Guard to King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, but having twice or thrice had his hand in the bloud of men ſlain in Duels, and being now condemn'd to dye with the reſt, upon very great ſuit made for him he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed hither with them, whither yet Divine Juſtice ſeem'd to perſue him, for being a very ſtout reſolute man and abuſing the Natives, he was ſoon after his arrival ſurprized by them who ſhot his Body ſo full of Arrows that he look't like the man in the Almanack, and ſeemed to be all one wound; The other ſeven recovered their Boat, and got off the Continent rowing toward the Iſland without much damage, but the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter running very high, as ſoon as they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore their Boat was ſplit in peices, ſo that they were then forc't to continue in that miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable place where never a Tree grew either for Suſtenance, Shelter or Shade, nor any thing elſe to ſuſtain their lives, having no freſh Water but what the Showers left in the holes of the Rocks; And which added to their miſery, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded ſo with venemous Serpents that it was very dangerous treading in the long Graſs for fear of them; They had but a ſmall quantity
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44690:80"/>of dry Bisket, their Bellies were hungry, and their ſleep unſafe, ſo that nothing could render their condition more unhappy, and yet theſe ſeven vile Wretches all lived to be made exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Divine Juſtice, for after they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this deſolate place five or ſix months, and were all grown almoſt mad with Famine, it pleaſed God that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship came into that Road bound for <hi>England;</hi> Four of theſe ſeven grew ſo impatient of an hours ſtay there, that immediately after the Ship came in they made a float of the Ruins of their ſplit Boat, and other Wood, and with ravell'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted Boat Ropes faſtning as well as they could, all together, extremity inſtructing them, they got thereon poizing it to the beſt advantage, hoping by the benefit of their Oars, and ſtrength of the Tide which ran quick toward the Ship to recover her; But their expectation failed them, for it being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Evening when they made this attempt, and not being diſcovered by the Ship which then rid a good way up in their Bay, before they could come near her, the Tyde return'd and carried them back into the main Sea, where they all were caſt away.</p>
               <p>The day following the Ship ſent a Boat to the Iſland, which took theſe three yet ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into her, as the other four might have been had their patience held out but one night lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who gave this account of their Fellows
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44690:81"/>misfortune; But notwithſtanding all the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of theſe miſcreants, yet they behaved themſelves ſo lewdly in the Ship in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn homeward, that they were very often put in the Bilbows; At length the Ship arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſafely in the Downs ſhe had not been at Anchor three hours, when theſe Villains got aſhore, where they had not been above three hours but they committed a Robbery, and a very few hours after were all apprehended for the Fact, and ſuddenly after that, their irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimable humor being related to the Lord Chief Juſtice, they were by his ſpecial War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Executed as incorrigible Wretches upon their former Sentence, near <hi>Sandwich</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where they committed their Crime. The year following three other condemned Perſons were carried to be left in this place, but hearing of the ill ſucceſs of their Predeceſſors, and that they were unlike to be ſafe here when the Ships were ready to depart and leave them on ſhore, they all came and preſented themſelves on their Knees with tears in their Eyes before our Captain <hi>Joſeph,</hi> humbly beſeeching him to order them to be Hanged in that place before they went, which they choſe much rather than to be left there; It was a very ſad ſight to behold three men in ſuch a condition that they ſhould eſteem Hanging to be a mercy; Our Commander told them he had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Execute them, but to leave them
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44690:81"/>there, and ſo he muſt do, and probably had done, but our fifth Ship the <hi>Swan</hi> ſtaying in this place a day or two after took theſe poor men in. And ſo much for the Bay of <hi>Souldania.</hi>

               <p>Poſſeſſed of all his Maſters Wealth, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected eaſe, and being till-then of no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at leaſt a Pagan, he began to hearken to <hi>Sergius</hi> a <hi>Neſtorian</hi> Monk, who flying out of <hi>Syria</hi> for fear of puniſhment (the Hereſies of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> being newly both revived and

               <p>Their Opinions of the end of the World are very rediculous, as that at the Winding of an Horn, not all Fleſh only, but the Angels themſelves ſhall dye; That the Earth with an Earthquake ſhall be kneaded together like a lump of Dough; That a ſecond blaſt of the ſame Horn ſhall after forty days reſtore all again; That <hi>Cain</hi> ſhall be the Captain or Ring leader of the damned who ſhall have the Faces of Dogs and Swine; That they ſhall paſs over the Bridge of Juſtice laden with their ſins in Satchels; That the greater Sinners ſhall fall into Hell, the leſſer into Purgatory only, with a thouſand the like fopperies needleſs to relate, which may be found in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> a thing ſo full of Tautologies, incoherences, and groſs abſurdities of ſo impure and carnal mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that whoever is taken with it muſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his natural reaſon, if Force, Ambition, or want of Chriſtian Education, do not induce him to imbrace it. For if we ſeriouſly conſider the cauſes of the deplorable increaſe and long continuance of this Religion, we ſhall find them to be cheifly theſe. 1. The greatneſs of the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44690:90"/>Victories obtain'd by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> who eaſily compell'd the conquered Nations to receive their Law. 2. The great zeal and diligence of the <hi>Arabians</hi> themſelves, who being a numerous people, and much given to Merchandize have poſſeſſed themſelves of all the Seacoaſts of <hi>Africk</hi> from the Streights of <hi>Babel Mandel</hi> almoſt to the <hi>Cape of Good Hope;</hi> of all the Iſlands in thoſe Seas, and many Factories and good Towns on the Coaſts of <hi>India,</hi> in all which they have ſetled their Religion alſo, as a thing inſeparable from their Nation. 3. A peremptory reſtraint of all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations in any point of Religion whatſoever. 4. The Suppreſſing Philoſophy and the Study of Humane Sciences, the light whereof might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily detect the groſneſs of their Superſtitions. 5. The ſenſual liberty allowed of having variety of Wives, and as many Concubines as they are able to keep. 6. The promiſe of the like ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual pleaſures in the other World, with which a mind not illuminated with the Spirit of God, is generally more affected, than with the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative hope of a future happineſs. 7. The forbidding Printing and Printed Books, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by people might perceive the truth and purity of the Chriſtian Faith, with the Falſhood and impurity of the Law of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> Yet had not theſe laſt been ſufficient to induce the belief of ſuch abſurdities if the firſt had not opened and prepared the way.</p>
               <p>For force of Arms was really the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44690:90"/>Argument by which <hi>Mahomet</hi> himſelf confirmed, and his Succeſſors ſince have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and diſperſed his Doctrine; Who being ſtrengthned by that Raſcal Rabble which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted to him, he aſſaults <hi>Medina</hi> pretending a quarrel to the Jews, who had there a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, repulſed at firſt with loſs of men and a wound in his face by which ſome of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeth were beaten out, and was there likely to have ended his New Religion, if not recovered by his Souldiers for further miſchief. At the next onſet he prevail'd, the Battel being ſought neer a place called <hi>Bedez,</hi> ſcituate betwixt <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Medina,</hi> frequently mentioned in the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> After which fight he took the City, converting the Synagogue to a Temple for his own impieties; The News hereof ſo ſtartled the Nobility of <hi>Mecca</hi> that they armed all their powers againſt him and ſucceeded ſo well in the beginning of the War that they drove him forcibly from their Territories, which yet not long after he again ſubdued and made his cheif Reſidence at <hi>Mecca.</hi> From that his flight the <hi>Saracens</hi> compute their years, (as we from Chriſts Nativity) which they call the <hi>Hegira,</hi> and begins about the year of our Lord 617. ſo termed from an <hi>Arabick</hi> word that ſignifies; <hi>The Perſecution raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion.</hi> It happened about this time that the <hi>Saracens</hi> revolting from <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Eaſtern Emperor joined themſelves to <hi>Mahomet</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:44690:91"/>being exaſperated by <hi>Julian the Apoſtate</hi> whom they ſerved in his Wars againſt the <hi>Perſians</hi> for telling them, upon demanding their pay. <hi>That he had greater ſtore of Steel than Gold;</hi> But they then wanted a Head to reſort to; Now ſerving <hi>Heraclius</hi> in the ſame War, they were uſed by his Officers in the ſame ill manner, for asking their pay, the Treaſurer of the Army made them this Churliſh anſwer, <hi>There is ſcarce Money enough to pay the</hi> Roman and Graecian <hi>Souldiers, and why muſt thoſe Dogs be ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate for their Wages?</hi> Provoked herewith, and hearing the fame of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> they joined him, who ſtrengthned herewith, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of the reſt of their Countreymen he ſoon brought all <hi>Arabia</hi> under his Subjection, and having defeated the Emperors forces ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him he conquered ſome parts of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi> and returning to <hi>Mecca</hi> there died frantick and diſtempered, in the 70 year of his Age, and twenty third of his Impoſtures, of which he ſpent thirteen at <hi>Medina</hi> and the reſt at <hi>Mecca.</hi> His dead Body being kept four days in expectation of a Reſurrection which he promiſed to perform at the end of three grown full of ſtench and putrefaction, was carried to <hi>Medina</hi> and there interred; His Succeſſors out of wicked and Worldly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy keeping up the reputation of that Religion after his deceaſe which they ſcorned and derided in his life, calling themſelves <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liphs</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:44690:91"/>and Vicar Generals to him their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Perſia,</hi> the Government of that Empire is purely Deſpotick or Tyrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, for the King has the ſole Power of life and death over all his Subjects, independent from his Council, and without any Trials or Law Proceedings. He can put to what death he pleaſes the chief Lords of the Kingdom, no man daring to diſpute the reaſon; Nor is there any Soveraign in the World more abſolute than he. The King deceaſing and leaving Male Iſſue behind him,- the Eldeſt aſcends the Throne, while his Brothers are kept in the <hi>Haram</hi> or Caſtle, and their Eyes put out, and if the King have the leaſt jealouſy they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly put to death without further Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not only they, but the Children of the Kings Brothers and Siſters likewiſe; I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ſaith my Author, when I firſt travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into <hi>Perſia</hi> they were not ſo rigorous, but were contented to move a red hot Iron to and fro before their Eyes; But <hi>Sha Sefi</hi> the laſt Emperor peceiving his command negligently Executed, and that the poor unhappy Princes had ſome ſight left them, he ordered their Eyes to be digged out of their Heads; <hi>Sha Sefi</hi>'s cruelty went yet further, for he ſpared not his Eldeſt Son <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> the lawful Heir of his Throne, ordering one of the Eunuchs to move an Iron before his Eyes, no man
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:44690:92"/>knowing a reaſon, but the Eunuch compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating the young Prince, moved an Iron yet not red hot before his Eyes, and teaching him to counterfeit himſelf blind, preſerv'd his ſight till his Father lay upon his Death bed, when being very Penitent for having put out the Eyes of his Eldeſt Son to whom the Crown did of right belong, the Eunuch ſeeing the King ſo ſadly afflicted, and ready to give up the Ghoſt, aſſured him that he would reſtore the Prince to his ſight, and to comfort him at his death, brought the Prince with perfect Eyes to his Bed-ſide, the ſight of whom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed the Kings life till the next day, and gave him time to command all the Grandees of the Court to obey <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> his Eldeſt Son, as his lawful Succeſſor and their King.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral of theſe Blind Princes at <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> and I knew one particularly, ſaith my Author, who is ſtill alive and a Perſon of excellent natural Parts; As Blind as he is, he is a great lover of Curioſities, and has built him a Houſe at <hi>Iſpahan</hi> worth ſeeing. He is overjoyed when he meets with any rarities out of <hi>Europe,</hi> feeling them in his hands, and cauſing his Eunuchs who are very apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to tell him the meaning of every thing; He is a great admirer of Clock-work and Watches, and to know what a Clock it is, he has little points ſet up in the Dial Plate, and a half hand that he may not be deceived
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44690:92"/>which points to the hour; With certain Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures which he makes of ſoft Wax, and ſets in order upon a Table, he will caſt up an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count very exactly, ſeveral other good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are eminent in him, and it is a miſerable ſpectacle that a man ſhould be reduced to that deplorable condition only becauſe he is of the Blood-Royal of <hi>Perſia.</hi> This State is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed like moſt of thoſe in <hi>Europe</hi> into three bodies, firſt that of the Sword, which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the Nobility, and conſiſts of the Kings Houſhold, the <hi>Kans</hi> or Governors, and all the Souldiery. The ſecond that of the Gown, comprehending all thoſe that belong to the Law and Courts of Juſtice. The third is compoſed of Merchants, Handicrafts men, and Labourers.</p>
               <p>Among other cunning contrivances, which <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> made uſe of to know the true State of his Affairs without truſting too much to his Miniſters, he oft diſguiſed himſelf and went into the City like an ordinary man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of buying and ſelling, making it his buſineſs to diſcover whether falſe Weights and Meaſures were uſed; Going therefore one Evening out of his Palace in the habit of a Countreyman, he went to a Bakers to buy a Man of Bread, and thence to a Cooks to buy a Man of Roaſt-meat, (a Man is ſix pound ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ounces to the pound) the King having bought his bargains return'd to the Court,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44690:93"/>where he cauſed them to be weighed exactly, he found the Bread to want 57 Drams, and the Meat 43. Upon which he fell into a great rage againſt the Officers about him who ought to regulate ſuch abuſes, but eſpecially againſt the Governor of the City, whoſe Belly he had cauſed to have been ript up but for the interceſſion of certain Lords. Beſides the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches he uſed toward them for their negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and little affection to the Publick good, diſcourſing of the injuſtice of falſe Weights, and how ſadly the cheat fell upon poor men, who having great Families, and thinking to give them eight hundred Drams of Bread, by that fraud deprived them of an hundred forty three, then turning to the Lords preſent, he demanded what ſort of Juſtice ought to be done to thoſe People, when none of them da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to open their mouths while he was in that Paſſion, he commanded a great Oven to be made in the Market place, together with a Spit big and long enough to Roaſt a Man, and that the Oven ſhould be heated all night, and another Fire to be kindled near the Oven. The next Morning the King cauſed the Cook and Baker to be apprehened, and to be led quite through the City with two men going before them; who proclaimed to the People; <hi>We are going to put the Baker into a red hot Oven in the</hi> Piazza <hi>to be Baked alive for ſelling Bread by falſe Weights, and the Cook is to be
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44690:93"/>Roaſted alive for having ſold Meat by falſe Weights.</hi> Thus theſe two men ſerved for an Example not only to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> but to all the Kingdom, where every one dreaded the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Juſtice of <hi>Sha Abbas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sha Abbas</hi> his Succeſſor acted almoſt ſuch another piece of ſeverity, for having made one <hi>Jafer Kan</hi> a generous Lord, who kept a magnificent Train, Governor of <hi>Aſterabat;</hi> At firſt he was very mild, but at laſt he began to exact ſuch ſums from the People, that his violences reached the Kings Ear, who being one day drinking with his Lords, and ſeeing the Maſter of his Muſick in the Room, who was a merry Droll, and had always ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant news to tell the King, he was pleas'd to ask him what the People ſaid of <hi>Jafer-Kan,</hi> adding that he had made him Governor of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Provinces, and had never heard any complaint of him, but now he was accuſed of ſtrangely Tyranizing over the People. The Muſick Maſter being a meer Flatterer, and knowing that <hi>Jafer-Kan</hi> was extreamly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the King, confidently aver'd, that the Governor was faſly accuſed, and that he had always known him apter to give than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. There was at the ſame time in the Room an <hi>Agis</hi> lately returned from a Pilgrimage at <hi>Mecca,</hi> him the King alſo asked what was his opinion of <hi>Jafer-Kan</hi> and his Government, being a Perſon long acquainted with him, to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44690:94"/>whom the <hi>Agis</hi> thinking to pleaſe the King, returned the ſame anſwer with the Muſick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Whereupon the King who had been well informed of the <hi>Kans</hi> behaviour, turning toward the Lords preſent, <hi>What think you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>of theſe two Flatterers that abſolutely know the contrary to what they ſpeak.</hi> And at the ſame time commanded two of the Muſick Maſters Teeth to be pluckt out of his Mouth, and to be driven into the head of the <hi>Agis,</hi> which had like to have coſt him his Life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very old man; As for <hi>Jafer-Kan</hi> he was diſgraced for a time, but his excellent Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments ſoon reſtored him again to favour.</p>
               <p>Murther is ſeverely puniſhed, nor will Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſave the Criminal; When the Murtherer is taken they carry him before the Magiſtrate who makes quick work, for he delivers him to the Parents or kindred of the Perſon ſlain who carry him to Execution, and without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion torture him to death. I remember ſaith my Author, the Governor of <hi>Shiras</hi> had a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, who falling in love with a young <hi>Perſian</hi> Gentleman earneſtly endeavoured to abuſe his Body; One day meeting upon the Road together, and lying at night under the ſame Tent, the Favourite about Mid-night came to his Bed-ſide, and after many Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would have forced him; But being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently reſiſted, the Favourite for Madneſs to find himſelf diſappointed, and liable to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44690:94"/>ſtab'd the young Gentleman to the heart, and fled to the Mountains. The Murther being divulged, the Mother, Widdow, and Siſter of the Young Man repaired to the Governor for Juſtice, who willing to ſave his Favourite offered them Money, which they with ſcorn refuſing, &amp; threatning to complain to the King, he was thereupon conſtrain'd to perſue his Favourite, at length he took &amp; ſent him to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> ſaying, he would not judge of the Affair, but refer it to the K. The Mother, Widdow, and Siſter immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed the Murtherer to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Juſtice of the King with that eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that though the King had an inclination to ſave the Favourite for the Governors Sake, he was forced to abandon him and bid them pay themſelves with his bloud. Immediately he was carried to Execution, where the Widdow firſt ſtab'd him to the heart with a dagger, then the Mother took her turn, and after that the Siſter, and then holding a Cup to receive his Blood, drank every one a Cup full to quench the thirſt of their Revenge.</p>
               <p>Above all things extraordinary care is taken for ſecuring the high ways, for which purpoſe Guards are ſet at convenient diſtances; As the Caravan was one day ſetting out from <hi>Tauris</hi> to <hi>Iſpahan,</hi> a poor Fellow took an occaſion to rob a Cloak-Bag, and fled croſs the Feilds not knowing the way, the Merchant miſſing his Goods complain'd to the Governor who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44690:95"/>ſought for him in vain, ſent order to the Guards to ſearch ſtrictly for him, and ſend him as ſoon as ſeized. In a ſhort time the Thief was conſtrained to forſake his Cloak-bag, and came croſs the Fields for Water, who being ſeized was carried to the Governor, and ſoon convicted and condemned to Death, for Thieves find no mercy in <hi>Perſia;</hi> Only they are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly put to death, being ſometimes tyed to a Camels tayl by the feet, and their Bellies ript open. Sometimes they are buried alive all but their Heads, and ſtarved to Death, in which torment they will oft deſire Paſſengers to cut off their Heads, though it be a kindneſs forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by the Law. But the moſt cruel puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all is, when they ſet the Thief on Horſe back with his extended Arms faſtned to a long ſtick behind; then larding him with lighted Candels, they ſuffer them to burn him to the very Bowels; We met two in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery who deſired us to haſten their Deaths, which we durſt not do, only we gave them a Pipe of Tobacco according to their deſire. One day there was a great Hubbub in a Bawdy-Houſe where the Woman had proſtituted her own Daughter, the King informed of it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Mother to be thrown Head-long from a Tower, and that the Daughter ſhould be torn in Peices by his Dogs, which he keeps on purpoſe for ſuch Chaſtizements.</p>

He ſhipt himſelf for <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> now called by the <hi>Turks Stambole,</hi> where he ſtrictly obſerved all remarkables and found much reſpect and incouragement from St. <hi>Paul Pindar</hi> then Ambaſſador there, to whoſe Houſe he had always free Acceſs; Here he took opportunity to view ſeveral parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> and in the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> took ſpecial notice of thoſe two Caſtles directly oppoſite to each other called <hi>Seſtos</hi> and <hi>Abidos</hi> that ſtand on the ſeveral Banks which bound that very narrow Sea, and is famous by the Story of <hi>Hero</hi> and <hi>Leander;</hi> He much deſired to ſee thoſe ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which lye now in ruins, only <hi>Smyrna</hi> is ſtill famous for Trade but not Religion, and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with ſome others, which retain their names ſtill, though they have loſt the profeſſion of their Faith with the reſt. He ſaw what yet remains of the Ruins of ſometimes Great <hi>Troy,</hi> a place once ſo populons as if ſown with people but now with ſtanding Corn, the very ruins of which place are almoſt gone to ruine, there only remaining part of an exceeding great Houſe, ſuppoſed part of the famous Palace of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44690:97"/>Great King <hi>Priam.</hi> From <hi>Smyrna</hi> he found Paſſage to <hi>Gran Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> anciently called <hi>Memphis</hi> where he obſerved the remains of the once famed Pyramids; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning thence back to <hi>Alexandria</hi> with another <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> they paſſed by Sea to <hi>Joppa</hi> where they met ſome others going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> with whom joining, they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled thither through a very Solitary, Rocky, uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable way full of danger from the Wild <hi>Arabs,</hi> who Rob and abuſe Travellers; Arriving at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> they ſaw and heard all wherewith Pilgrims are uſually treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which you have a full Account in a ſmall Book called <hi>Two Journeys to Jeruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> Here our Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler had the Arms of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> made upon the wriſt of his left Arm, and on his Right a ſingle Croſs made like that whereon our Saviour ſuffered on the ſides of which were written, <hi>Via, Veritas, Vita, The way, Truth, and Life,</hi> and on the foot three Nails to ſignifie thoſe which faſtened our Saviour to it, done ſo artificially and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delibly by a Black Powder as if drawn by ſome accurate Pencil upon Parchment.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44690:98"/>after <hi>Noahs</hi> Flood, they went thence to <hi>Iſpahan</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> the uſual reſidence of <hi>Sha Abbas,</hi> and after that to <hi>Shuſhan</hi> where King <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> kept his Court in <hi>Eſthers</hi> time, from thence they journeyed to <hi>Candahor</hi> the firſt Province North-Eaſt under the <hi>Great Mogol,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Lahore</hi> the ſecond City of this Empire, a place of great Trade, Wealth and Delight, more temperate from the Suns heat than any other of his great Cities; At length he arrived at <hi>Agra</hi> the <hi>Mogols</hi> Metropolis, from <hi>Lahore</hi> to <hi>Agra</hi> is four hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles, the Countrey very rich, even, and pleaſant, and the Road way on both ſides all this long diſtance planted with great Trees, clothed all the year long with Leaves, of exceeding benefit to Travellers in that hot Clime, it is called by Travellers, <hi>The Long-Walk,</hi> very full of Villages and Towns convenient for the ſupply of Travellers.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Agra</hi> our Traveller made a halt being kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory, and there learned the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> Languages, with ſome proficiency in the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Indoſtan</hi> Tongues, in both which he got ſo much knowledge as was very advantagious to him in his Travels through the <hi>Mogols</hi> Territories, he always wearing the habit, and ſpeaking the Language of that Nation; He afterward made an Oration to the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, bringing in the Story of the Queen of <hi>Sheba.</hi> 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 10. In which parts of the Sacred Scripture the <hi>Mahometans</hi> have ſome knowledge, and told the King that as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> having heard of the Fame of King <hi>Solomon</hi> came from far to viſit him, and confeſſed that ſhe had not been told half of what ſhe now ſaw concerning the Wiſdom, Greatneſs, Retinue and Riches of <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſo ſaid our Orator, <hi>I had heard much of your Majeſty before I had the honour of your ſight, when I was very far off in my own Countrey, but what I now behold exceedingly ſurmounts all the reports thereof.</hi> Then intermixing other flatteries with his ſhort Speech, he concluded, and was very well liked by the <hi>Mogol,</hi> who gave him an hundred
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44690:98"/>Roupies, about twelve pound ten Shillings in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, looking on him as a <hi>Derviſe</hi> Prophet, or Pilgrim as he called him, who in that Countrey value not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which might be the reaſon he did not reward him more liberally. He after got a great maſtery in the <hi>Indoſtan</hi> or Vulgar Language, and a Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador there, having ſuch freedom of Speech that ſhe would ſcold and rail from Morning to Night, <hi>Coriat</hi> one day undertook her in her own Dialect, and by eight a Clock in the Morning ſo ſilenced her that ſhe had not one word more to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>At the four Corners of their Moſquets or Churches in this Countrey there are high, round, ſmall Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, open with light every way wherein a man may be eaſily ſeen and heard, into the top of theſe their devout <hi>Moola</hi>'s or Prieſts aſcend five times every day whence they proclaim as loud as poſſible theſe <hi>Arabian</hi> words, <hi>La alla, illa, alla Mahomet Reſul-alla,</hi> that is, <hi>There is no God but one God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>the Meſſenger from God,</hi> this voice is inſtead of Bells, which they uſe not in their Churches, and puts the moſt devout in mind of their Religion; One time <hi>Tom Coryat</hi> hearing their Prieſt thus crying, got upon a high place di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to him, and thus contradicted him, <hi>La alla illa alla, Haſaret Eeſa Benalla,</hi> that is, <hi>No God but one God, and the Lord Chriſt the Son of God,</hi> and further added, <hi>That</hi> Mahomet <hi>was an Impoſtor;</hi> All this he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in their own Language as loud as poſſible in the Ears of many <hi>Mahometans</hi> preſent, but it may be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned whether the judgment or diſcretion of our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim were more to be commended, for if this had been acted in many other places of <hi>Aſia</hi> it would have coſt him his Life with as much torture as cruelty could have invented, but being here taken for a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man he was let alone, and haply the rather ſince every one there has liberty to profeſs his own Religion free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if he pleaſe may argue againſt theirs without danger; As <hi>Tom Coryat</hi> did another time with a <hi>Moola;</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:44690:99"/>The queſtion was which of them was the Muſſelman or true Believer; After much heat on both ſides <hi>Coryat</hi> made this Learned diſtinction, <hi>That himſelf was the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Muſſelman or True True Believer, and the Prieſt the Pſeudo Muſſelman, or Falſe True Believer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a man of a very coveting Eye, who could never be ſatisfied with ſeeing, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks, and took as much pleaſure therein as others in injoying great and rare things; He had the maſtery of many hard Languages, beſides <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> which he brought from <hi>England,</hi> and had he had Wiſdom to manage them as he had ſkill to ſpeak them, he had deſerved more Fame in his Generation, but his Attainments made him ignorant of himſelf, being ſo ambitious of praiſe that he would hear more than he could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly deſerve, being like a Ship with too much Sail, and too little Ballaſt, yet had he not fallen into the ſmart hands of the Wits of thoſe times he might have paſſed better.</p>
               <p>On a time a Merchant who came from <hi>England</hi> met <hi>Tom Coryat</hi> as he was travelling toward. <hi>Eaſt India,</hi> and told him that when he was in <hi>England</hi> King <hi>James</hi> (then living) inquired after him, and when he had certified him of his meeting him, the King replyed, <hi>Is that Fool yet living?</hi> Which when our Pilgrim heard, he was much concerned becauſe the King ſpake no more nor better of him, ſaying, that Kings would ſpeak of poor men what they pleaſed; Another time the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ambaſſador gave him a Letter (with a Bill to receive ten pound) to the Conſul of <hi>Alappo,</hi> wherein were theſe words, <hi>Sir, when you ſhall hand theſe Letters, I deſire you to receive the Bearer of them Mr.</hi> Thomas Coryat <hi>with Courteſy, for you ſhall find him a very honeſt poor Wretch, and further I muſt intreat you to furniſh him with ten pounds which ſhall be repay'd,</hi> &amp;c. Our Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim liked the gift well but the Language much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed him, ſaying, <hi>That my Lord Ambaſſador had even ſpoiled his Courteſy in the carriage thereof, ſo that if he had been a very Fool indeed he could have ſaid very little leſs of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44690:99"/>him than he did to call him honeſt poor Wretch, and to ſay no more of him was to ſay as much as nothing, and his favour does rather trouble than pleaſe me, when I was at</hi> Venice, ſaid he, <hi>a Perſon of Honour wrote thus on my behalf to Sir</hi> Hen. Wotton <hi>then Ambaſſador there,</hi> My Lord good Wine needs no Buſh, neither a worthy man Letters Commendatory, becauſe whitherſoever he goes he is his own Epiſtles, <hi>this,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>was ſome Language on my behalf;</hi> At length his Letter was phraſed to his mind, but he never lived to receive the money; A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death he ſeem'd apprehenſive thereof, for ſwounding away once, upon his recovery he declared the occaſion was, for fear he ſhould die in the way toward <hi>Surat</hi> whither he intended to go, and be buried in obſcurity, and none of his Friends know what became of him, he travelling now as he uſually did alone; Upon which the Ambaſſador willed him to ſtay longer, which he thankfully refuſed, and preſently turned his Face for <hi>Surat,</hi> which was then about three hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles diſtant, and lived to come ſafe thither, where being over-kindly treated by ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> who gave him Sack which they had brought from <hi>England,</hi> he calling for it as ſoon as he heard of it, and crying, <hi>Sack, Sack, is there ſuch a thing as Sack, pray give me ſome Sack,</hi> and drinking of it, though not immoderately (being very temperate) it increaſed his Flux that he had then upon him, which cauſed him in a few days after his tedious and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome Travels (for he went moſt on foot) to come at this place to his Journeys end, for here he overtook death, <hi>Dec.</hi> 1617. and was buried at <hi>Swalley</hi> under a little Monument like thoſe in our Church-yards.</p>
               <p>Now to return, <hi>Cambaia</hi> is three Miles from the River <hi>Indus</hi> and as many in compaſs, one of the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and beſt built Cities in all the Eaſt, ſo populous as judg'd to contain an hundred and thirty thouſand Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. <hi>Swalley</hi> is more South and about a Mile from the Sea, but gives name to a darge capacious Bay where the Ships ride that trade to <hi>Surat;</hi> About
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44690:100"/>ten Miles from this Bay is <hi>Surat,</hi> from whence the River is navigable only for Boats and Shallops, fortified with a Caſtle of Stone, and well ſtored with Ordnance. The Houſes are for the moſt part built of Sun-dried Bricks very large and laſting, with flat roofs but bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemented on all ſides for fear of falling, and beautified with curions Gardens of Pomegranats, Melons, Figs and Lemons, interlaced with Rivulets and Springs; It is a Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, who have their Preſident, and a magnificent Houſe for the reception, and Staple of their Commodities.</p>
               <p>The preſent Emperor or Mogol is called <hi>Aureng-zeb,</hi> having uſurpt the Kingdom from his Father <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> upon this occaſion. This great King having reigned forty years with much Clemency and Juſtice, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining Age he fancied a Young Lady of extraordinary beauty not above thirteen years old, and becauſe the ſtrength of nature would not permit him to ſatisfy his paſſion, he took certain Provocatives which were ſo hot, that he fell thereupon into a diſtemper which had almoſt killed him. This obliged him to ſhut himſelf up in his Court or Apartment, together with his Women for two or three Months during which time he very ſeldom appeared to his people and that at a great diſtance too, which made them believe he was dead. He had ſix Children four Sons and two Daughters, whom he loved all alike, making his Sons Governors or Vice Roys of four of the principal Provinces in his Kingdom; During the falſe report of his death, the Eldeſt Son kept with him, but the other 3 immediatly rebelled, &amp; after many Skirmiſhes and much bloud-ſhed <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> his third Son after the deſtruction of his three Brethren, cauſed himſelf to be declared King keeping his Father Priſoner; Some days before he aſcended the Throne he ſent to his Father for ſome of his Jewels, that he might appear before his people with the ſame magnificence his Predeceſſors had done, <hi>Cha-jehan</hi> taking this requeſt of his Sons for an affront put upon him in Priſon, fell into ſuch a rage that he continued
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44690:100"/>mad for ſome days, and had like to have died upon it; In the exceſs of this Vexation he called ſeveral times for a Mortar and Peſtle, threatning to beat all his Jewels to Powder rather than his Son ſhould have them, but <hi>Begum Saheb</hi> his Eldeſt daughter who never forſook him, throwing her ſelf at his feet, and by virtue of that Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal power ſhe had over him as being both his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and his Wife, kept him from uſing that extremity more out of deſign to preſerve, the Jewels for herſelf than her Brother to whom ſhe was always a Mortal Enemy; For this reaſon when <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> aſcended the Throne he had only one Jewel on his Bonnet, and as a kind of Penance that he impoſed upon himſelf for ſo many Crimes, he for ſome time would not eat wheaten bread, Fleſh nor Fiſh, but fed dayly upon Barley Bread, Herbs and Sweat Meats; But <hi>Chajehan</hi> his Father dying in 1666. <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> found himſelf rid of an object that every hour reproached his Tyranny, and began to enjoy himſelf with more delight, receiving his Siſter <hi>Begum</hi> into favour, and calling her <hi>Cha Begum</hi> or <hi>Princeeſs Queen,</hi> a Woman of excellent accompliſhments, and able to govern an Empire, and had her Father and Brothers taken her Counſel at the beginning of the War <hi>Aureng-zeb</hi> had never been King; He had another Siſter called <hi>Rauchenara Begum</hi> who had always taken his part having ſent him all the Gold and Silver ſhe could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure when ſhe firſt heard he had taken Arms, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence whereof he promiſed her when he came to be King to give her the Title of <hi>Cha Begum,</hi> and that ſhe ſhould ſit upon a Throne, all which he performed, and they lived lovingly together, till it happened that the Princeſs having ſecretly conveyed a handſom young man into her Apartment could not let him out ſo private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after ſhe had quite tired him, but the King had notice thereof; Thereupon the Princeſs to prevent the ſhame and reproach ran to the King, and in a pretended fright told him, there was a man got into the Haram even to her very Chamber who certainly deſigned either to have killed or Robbed her, that ſuch an accident was never
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44690:101"/>before known, and that it concerned the ſafety of his Royal Perſon, and he would therefore do well to puniſh the Eunuchs who kept the Guard that night. The King ran inſtantly in Perſon with a great number of Eunuchs, ſo that the poor Young Man had no way to eſcape but by leaping out at a Window into the River that runs by the Pallace Walls, whereupon a multitude of people ran out to ſeize him, the Kieg commanding they ſhould do him no harm, but to carry him to the Officer of Juſtice, yet he happily made his eſcape, and has not been ſince heard of.</p>
               <p>It is an Ancient cuſtom among the <hi>Indians</hi> that the Huſband happening to dye the wife can never marry again, ſo that when he is dead, ſhe retires to bewail him, ſhaves her hair, and lays aſide all her ornaments, taking off from her Arms and Legs the Bracelets her Huſband put on when he eſpouſed her in token of her ſubmiſſion, and her being chained to him, and all her life after ſhe lives ſlighted and deſpiſed, yea worſe than a Slave in the Houſe where ſhe was formerly Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. This unfortunate conditon cauſes them to hate life and rather dye with their Huſbands than live in ſuch Contempt, the <hi>Bramins</hi> or Prieſts likewiſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them, that after death they ſhall meet him again in the other World with greater honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; Yet can no Woman burn with her Huſbands Body without leave from the Governor of the Place, who being a <hi>Mehometan</hi> and abhoring this execrable cuſtom of ſelf Murther does often deny it to ſome Women, who are ſo offended there at that they ſpend the reſt of their lives, in works of Charity, ſome ſit on the Road Boyling certain Pulſe in Water and giving the Liquor to Travellers to drink, others hold Fire ready in their hands to light their Tobacco, others make vows to eat nothing but the undigeſted grains, which they find in Cow-dung. But when the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor finds no perſwaſions will alter the Womans reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and eſpecially if he perceives by a ſign from his Secretary that ſhe has given him Money to that
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:44690:101"/>purpoſe, he in a ſurly manner gives her leave, bidding the Devil take her, and all her kindred; Immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Muſick ſtrikes up, and away they go to the Houſe of the deceaſed with Drums beating and Flutes playing before them, in which manner they accompany the Perſon who is to be burnt to the place appointed; All her kindred and Friends come and congratulate her for the happineſs ſhe is to enjoy in the other World, and the honour their Family receives by this her gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous reſolution, ſhe then dreſſes her ſelf as if going to be Married and is conducted in Triumph to the place of Execution, with aloud noiſe of Muſical Inſtruments and Womens voices who follow her, ſinging Songs in honour of the miſerable creature that is going to dye, the <hi>Bramins</hi> who accompany her, exhort her to courage and conſtancy, and many of our <hi>European</hi> Spectators are of opinion, that theſe Preiſts give her ſome ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Liquor to take away the fear of Death, for it is their intereſt that theſe miſerable wretches ſhould deſtroy themſelves, their Bracelets as well about their Legs as Arms, Pendants, Rings, and Jewels all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them who rake for them among the aſhes when ſhe is burnt; They burn them ſeveral ways, ſometimes a little Hut of Reeds is erected on the bank of a Pond or River, beſmeared with Oyl and other Drugs to increaſe the flame. The Woman is placed in the middle in a leaning poſture with her head on a kind of Wooden Bolſter, and reſting her back againſt a Pillar, to which the <hi>Bramin</hi> tyes her about the middle, leſt ſhe ſhould run away upon feeling the Fire, in this poſture ſhe holds the Body of her deceaſed Husband upon her knees, chewing Betele all the while, and when ſhe has continued thus about half an hour, the <hi>Bramin</hi> goes out and the Woman bids them fire the Hut, which is quickly done, her Rindred and Friends throwing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pots of Oyl into it, the ſooner to diſpatch her. In ſome places they only build up a Pile of Wood upon which the Woman is placed as on a Bed, with her Husbands Body layed croſs her, then ſome bring her a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:44690:102"/>Letter, others a peice of Calicoe, another peices of Silver or Copper deſiring her to deliver them to their Mother, Brother, Kinſman, or Friend in the other World, when ſhe has received all, ſhe puts them between her Husbands Body and her own tyed up in a peice of Taffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then calls to kindle the Pile wherewith ſhe is ſoon ſtifled, but there being ſcarcity of Wood in <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale,</hi> the bodies of theſe poor wretches are many times only grilliaded and then caſt into the River <hi>Ganges</hi> to be devoured by Crocodiles.</p>
               <p>The magnanimity of many of theſe Women is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; The <hi>Raja</hi> of <hi>Velou</hi> having loſt his City and his life in a Battle againſt the King of <hi>Viſapours</hi> General, he was extreamly lamented, and eleven of his Wives no leſs concerned, who reſolved to be burnt at his Funeral, which the General underſtanding, endeavoured to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them by all kind uſage, but finding perſwaſions in vain he ordered them to be ſhut up in a Room; He who had this command going to execute it, the Women in a rage told him, <hi>That 'twas to no purpoſe to keep them Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, for if they might not have leave to do what they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, in three hours there would not one of them be alive.</hi> The Perſon intruſted laughed at this Menace but the keeper of thoſe Women opening the Dores 3 hours after found them all ſtretched out dead up the place, without the leſt Mark or ſign of any outward violence offered to them. Two of the greateſt Lords of <hi>India</hi> came in 1642. to do Homage to <hi>Cha-jehan,</hi> who having offended the Grand Maſter of the Houſehold, he told one of them one day in the Kings preſence. <hi>That they had not behaved themſelves as became them toward ſo great a Monarch.</hi> The <hi>Raja,</hi> or Lord looking on himſelf as a great Prince, he and his Brother having brought with them a Train of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand Horſe, being netled at this bold reproof of the Grand Maſter, drew out his dagger and ſlew him on the place before the King; The Grand Maſter falling at the feet of his own Brother who ſtood juſt by him, he was going to revenge his Death, but was prevented by the <hi>Raja's</hi> Brother who ſtab'd him likewiſe, &amp; lay'd him
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44690:102"/>athwart his Brothers Body; The King ſeeing theſe 2 Murthers retired into his Apartment for fear, but the Nobles and people preſently fell upon the <hi>Raja's</hi> and cut them to peices; The King incenſed at ſuch an attempt committed in his houſe and preſence, commanded the bodies of the <hi>Raja's</hi> to be thrown into the River, which their Troops that they had left about <hi>Agria</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding threatned to enter the City and Pillage it, whereupon the King was adviſed for preventing the hazard to deliver them the bodies of their Princes. When they were to be burned thirteen Women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the two <hi>Raja's</hi> Houſes came dancing and leaping, and preſently got upon the Funeral Pile hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another by the hands, and being ſoon after ſtifled by the Smoak, fell together into the Fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the <hi>Bramins</hi> threw in great heaps of Wood, Pots of Oil, and other combuſtible matter to diſpatch them. When I was at <hi>Patna,</hi> ſaith my Author, a very handſom young Woman of about two and twenty came to deſire leave of the Governor to be burnt with the Body of her dead Husband; The Governor compaſſionating her Youth and Beauty, ſtrove to diſſwade her, but fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her reſolute, he ſeverely askt her, whether ſhe underſtood what the Torment of Fire was, and whether ſhe had ever burnt her Fingers? <hi>No, No,</hi> anſwered ſhe more ſtoutly than before, <hi>I do not fear fire, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

Some young Lords preſent deſired the Governor to call for a Torch and try her, which with much ado he did, as ſoon as the Woman ſaw it coming ſhe ran to meet it, and held her hand in the Flame without the leaſt altering her counterance, ſearing her Arm up to the very Elbow, that her Fleſh looked as if broil'd, whereupon the Governor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her out of his ſight.</p>
               <p>The Government of the <hi>Great Mogol</hi> is as Arbitrary and Tyrannical as his Neighbours aforementioned, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring his power by his Sword and Lance, and making
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44690:103"/>his will his Law, there being no Laws upon Record in this Conſtitution to regulate Governors in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice but what are written in the Breaſts of the King and his Subſtitutes, and therefore they often take the Liberty to puniſh the offender rather than the offence, mens perſons more than their Crimes, though they ſtill pretend to proceed by proofs and not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions. In matters of conſequence the <hi>Mogol</hi> himſelf will ſit as Judge, and no Malefactors lye above one night in Priſon and many times not at all, for if the Offender be apprehended early in the morning, he is inſtantly brought before the Judge, by whom he is preſently either acquitted or condemned, if it be Whipping, that is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted uſually with much ſeverity in the place of Juſtice; If condemned to dye he is preſently carried from Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to Execution, commonly in the Market-place, which quick Judgment keeps the People in ſuch awe, that there are not many Execution. Murder and Theft they puniſh with death of what kind the Judge pleaſe to impoſe, ſome Malefactors being hang'd, others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, ſome impaled or put upon ſharp Stakes, a death of extream cruelty and torture, ſome are torn to pieces by wild Beaſts, ſome killed by Elephants, and others Stung to death by Serpents. Thoſe that ſuffer by Elephants, who are trained up for Executions, are thus dealt withal; If the Beaſt be commanded by his Rider to diſpatch the poor trembling Offender preſently, who lies proſtrate before him, he with his broad round Foot at one ſtamp kills him, but if he be condemned ſo to die as to feel himſelf dye, the Elephant will break his Bones by degrees with his hard trunk, as firſt his Legs, then his Thighs, after that the Bones in both his Arms, this done his wretched Spirit is left to breath its laſt out of the midſt of thoſe broken Bones.</p>
               <p>It is reported that ſtrange kinds of deaths are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the command of the King of <hi>Japan</hi> upon his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, where ſome are Crucified or Nailed to a Croſs, others rather Roaſted than burnt to death, for there is a Stake ſet up; and a Fire made at a diſtance round about
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44690:103"/>it, the condemned Perſon being naked is ſo faſtned to the Stake that he may move round about it, and ſo doth as long as he is able to ſtir till his Fleſh begins to bliſter; Then he falls down, and there lies roaring till the Fire made about him puts him to ſilence, by taking away both his Voice and Life; The reaſon they give for uſing ſuch exquiſite torments is becauſe they count it diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable for any man to die by an Executioner, and therefore Criminals are uſually commanded to rip up their own Bellies, and thoſe who will not do ſo are tormented in dying, hence theſe Condemned Perſons call for their Friends about them, cat and ſeem to be merry with them, and in the cloſe of the Banquet, they in their preſence commit this ſad ſlaughter upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for being ſtript to the middle, the wretched ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murtherer ſtrikes a ſharp Knife into the bottom of his Belly, then rips himſelf up, and if after this he can wipe his bloody Knife upon a white Paper or Napkin laid by him, he is reckoned to dye with much honour, and is perſuaded he goes to <hi>Fakaman,</hi> or the God of War.</p>
               <p>When I was in <hi>India,</hi> ſaith my Author, one was ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced by the <hi>Mogol</hi> himſelf for killing his own Father to dye thus, firſt a ſmall Iron Chain was faſtned to his Heels, which was tyed to the hind Leg of a great Ele phant, who drag'd him one whole remove of that King being about ten miles, ſo that all his Fleſh was torn off his Bones when we met him, and appeared to us rather a Skeleton than a Body. Another having killed his own Mother, the Emperour was at a ſtand to think of a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment adequate to ſo horrible a crime, but after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pauſe, he adjudged him to be ſtung to death by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, accordingly one of thoſe Mountebanks who keep them to ſhew tricks to the people, brought two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents to do Execution upon this wretched man whom he ſound all naked, only a little covering before, and trembling. Then having angred theſe venemous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he put one of them to his Thigh, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly twined it ſelf about that part till it came near his Groin, and there bit him till Blood followed; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44690:104"/>was faſtned to the outſide of the other Thigh twiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it round, and there bit him likewiſe; Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wretch kept upon his Feet near a quarter of an hour, before which the Serpents were taken from him, but he complained extreamly of a Fire that with much torment had poſſeſſed all his Limbs, and his whole Body began to ſwell exceedingly, like <hi>Nafidius</hi> bit by a <hi>Lybyan</hi> Serpent called a <hi>Preſter,</hi> about half an hour after, the Soul of that unnatural Monſter left his groaning Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, and went to his place.</p>
               <p>It happened a few years before Sir <hi>Thomas Row</hi> was Ambaſſador in this Court in 1618. that a Jugler of <hi>Bengala,</hi> a place famous for Witches, brought an Ape before the <hi>Mogol,</hi> who loved Novelties, that did many ſtrange feats, the King to try his skill pluckt a Ring off his Finger, and gave it one of his Boys to hide, whom the Ape preſently diſcovered; ſeveral other trials he made, wherein the Ape did his part to admiration; Before he was taken out of his preſence, this ſtrange and unexpected fancy came into the Kings Head; <hi>There are many diſputes,</hi> ſaid he; <hi>about that true Prophet which ſhould come into the World, we are for</hi> Mahomet; <hi>The</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians <hi>magnifie</hi> Mortis Ally, <hi>the</hi> Hindoos <hi>or Heathens extol</hi> Bramon, Ram, <hi>and others, the</hi> Jews <hi>are for</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Chriſtians for Chriſt;</hi> adding ſeveral other names, to the number of twelve in all, who have all their ſeveral followers in that part of the World; He then cauſed them twelve names to be written on twelve ſeveral Scrolls, and put together to ſee if the Ape could draw out the name of the true Prophet, this done the Ape put his paw amongſt them and pull'd out the name of Chriſt; The <hi>Mogol</hi> a ſecond time cauſed theſe twelve names to be writ again in twelve other Scrolls and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and put together, when the Ape again pluckt forth the name of Chriſt as before; <hi>Mabomet Chan</hi> a great Favourite preſent, ſaid it was an Impoſture of the Chriſtians, though none were then there, and deſired he might make a third trial, which granted he put but eleven of thoſe names together, reſerving the name of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44690:104"/>Chriſt in his hand, the Ape ſearching as before pluckt forth his empty paw, and ſo twice or thrice together the King demanding a reaſon for this, was anſwered, that happily the thing he looked for was not there, the Ape was bid ſearch for it, who putting out thoſe eleven names one after the other in a ſeeming indignation rent them, then running to <hi>Mahobet Chan</hi> caught him by the hand where the name of Chriſt was concealed, which he opened, and held up to the King, but did not tear it as the former. Upon which the <hi>Mogol</hi> took the Ape, and gave his Keeper a good Penſion to keep him near about him, calling him <hi>the Divining Ape.</hi> And this was all which followed upon this admirable event, except the great wonder and amazement of the people, the truth whereof, ſaith my Author, I moſt certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as being confirmed to me by ſeveral Perſons of different Religions, who all agreed in the ſtory and the ſeveral circumſtances thereof.</p>
               <p>I cannot but here relate a remarkable example of a very groſs Flatterer, but a great Favourite of this King, who was noted above others of that Nation to be a great neglecter of God, believing it Religion enough to pleaſe the <hi>Mogol</hi> his Maſter, though a Souldier of approved va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. This man on a time ſitting in dalliance with one of his Women, ſhe pluckt an hair from his Breaſt about his Nipple in wantonneſs, without deſigning any hurt. This little inconſiderable wound by an unparallel'd fate became the occaſion of his death, beginning preſently to feſter, and in a ſhort time turned to an incurable Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; When he found he muſt needs dye, he ſpake theſe notable words worthy to be recorded, <hi>Who would not have thought but that I who have been ſo long a Souldier ſhould have died in the face of an Enemy, either by a Sword, Lance, Arrow, Bullet, or ſome ſuch Inſtrument of death? But now though too late I am forced to confeſs that there is a great God above, whoſe Majeſty I have ever deſpiſed, who needs no bigger Lance than an hair to kill an Atheiſt or a deſpiſer of his Divinity;</hi> and ſo deſiring theſe his laſt words might be told the King his Maſter, he died.</p>

               <p>The then <hi>Mogol</hi> ſent a Letter to our King <hi>James</hi> the firſt in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Language, which is here faithfully tranſlated to ſhew the manner and ſtile of the writing of that Court.</p>

               <p>In 1613 Captain <hi>Beſt</hi> Anchored in the Road at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin,</hi> and was kindly received, having an <hi>Araacia</hi> or Meſſenger ſent riding in a Tent on an Elephants back, attended with two or three of the Kings Boys, (for he is attended by Boys abroad and Women within) to receive his Majeſties Letter which was thus carried in a Baſon of Gold, the General following with forty or fifty men; After the Letter and Preſent was delivered, the King told them they ſhould ſee ſome of his paſtime, which was firſt Cock-fighting, next that of Rams, then his tame Elephants, after them his Buffoloes each ſtill exceeding the other in fierceneſs, laſtly the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopes which the General had given him; All this while the King took Tobacco in a Silver Pipe given him by his Women, who ſtood in a cloſe Room behind him. Then was Supper ſerved in by Boys of about fourteen, in in a Metal of Gold and Copper mixed, continuing from ſeven a Clock to almoſt twelve in which were ſerved in four hundred Diſhes, beſide hot Drinks; Next day the King ſent the General an Elephant to ride on which none may do without his leave, and appointed one of his Cheif Officers conſtantly to attend him, and free acceſs was granted him at all times, and the Articles agreed on between <hi>James Lancaſter</hi> and his Predeceſſor were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be ratified, <hi>May.</hi> 2. All ſtrangers were invited to a Feaſt kept at the Spring of a River in the Water, ſix miles from the City, two Elephants were ſent for the General, the diſhes were ſerved in by Boys, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with one hand and holding the Diſh, or ſtrong
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:44690:107"/>Drink in the other; Of all theſe drinks they muſt taſt, and then throw the reſt into the Water; This continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from one till five, they had 500 Diſhes well dreſſed; General <hi>Beſt</hi> weary of ſitting ſo long in the Water had leave to depart an hour before the reſt; The Captain of the <hi>Dutch</hi> got his Bane either by the hot Drinks or cold ſitting ſo long in the Water, and ſoon after died. The King gave the General a new Title, calling and charging his Nobles to call him <hi>Arancaia Pule</hi> that is, <hi>The honourable White Man; June</hi> 2. They were entertained with a fight of four Elephants and a Tyger who was faſtened to a Stake, and yet got ſuch hold on the Legs and Truncks of the Elephants that he made them roar and bleed extreamly. Sometimes Wild Elephants fight before him who would ſoon kill each other but that tame ones are faſtned to them who draw them back, fourſcore or an hundred men helping them; To tame them they place a Wild one between two that are tame.</p>

               <p>This Letter for the ſtrange boaſting form, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contains a ſmall Inventory of that Kings wealth is here inſerted; This King was a ſtout proper man of about thirty two, ſtrong by Sea and Land, his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey populous, his Elephants many, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there ſeen neer two hundred at a time; His Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates and Gallies carried good Ordnance of all kinds; His building ſtately, and ſpacious but not ſtrong; His Court at <hi>Achi</hi> pleaſant, having a fine River which he cut and brought eight Miles in twenty days while they were there; He deſired the General to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent his Reſpects to the King of <hi>England</hi> and to intreat him to ſend him two White Women; <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>if I get one of them with Child and it prove a Son I will make him K. of</hi> Piaman Paſſaman <hi>and of the Coaſt from whence you fetch your Pepper, ſo that you ſhall not need to come any more to me, but to your own</hi> Engliſh <hi>King for thoſe Commodities.</hi> He was cruel having pluckt out the Eyes of a Nobleman for look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one of the Kings Women waſhing in a River; Another wearing a Shaſh or Turbant beyond his degree, had his head cut round, ſo far as that was two large; Some he boiled in ſcalding Oyl, others were ſawn aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Spitted alive, had their Legs cut off, or were otherwiſe tortured. The People are tawny and go naked, yet paint their faces, their Prieſts in their Sacrifices wear their Garments ſo cloſe as if they were ſowed to them with horns on their head turning back, and a Tail hanging down behind, for ſo they ſay the Devil appears to them, their Hair and Faces appear deformed with Green, Black and Yellow Colours.</p>
               <p>Another conſiderable <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory is at <hi>Bantam</hi> and other places on the Iſle of <hi>Java Major,</hi> this is the chief City in the whole Iſland, ſcituate at the foot of a Mountain, whence iſſue three Rivers, two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of run by the Walls, and the other through the midſt of the City, yet none of them deep enough to admit of any Ships, the Houſes are very mean, conſiſting of three chief Streets; The Natives are Heathens, and believe when they dye their Souls enter into ſome Bird,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44690:109"/>Beaſt or Fiſh, and therefore they eat neither Fleſh nor Fiſh, yet toward the South are many who profeſs the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Religion, and ſome of them called <hi>Faquirs</hi> are deſperate Villains, who having been at <hi>Mecca</hi> to viſit <hi>Mahomets</hi> Tomb, upon their return they run through the Streets and kill all they meet with their poyſoned Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and think that in ſo doing they do God and <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi> good ſervice and ſhall be ſaved thereby; If any of theſe Mad-men are kill'd their Followers bury them as Saints, and every one contributes toward erecting them a fair Tomb, which they viſit, and beſtow Alms upon the Keeper thereof. I remember ſaith my Author, that in 1642. a Veſſel of the <hi>Great Mogols</hi> returned from <hi>Mecca</hi> to <hi>Surat</hi> with a great number of theſe <hi>Faquirs</hi> or <hi>Derviches,</hi> and one of them was no ſooner landed and had ſaid his Prayers, but he inſtantly took his Dagger and ran among ſeveral <hi>Dutch</hi> Marriners who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lading goods upon the Shore, and before they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware this deſperate Wretch had wounded ſeventeen of them whereof thirteen died, at length the Sentinel who ſtood at the entry of the Tent where the Governour and Merchants were, ſhot him through the Body ſo that he fell down dead; Immediately all the other <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirs</hi> and <hi>Mahometans</hi> who were upon the place took up the Body and buried it, and at the end of fifteen days they had erected him a fair Monument; Every year the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> pluckt it down, but when they are gone the <hi>Faquirs</hi> rebuild it, and plant Banners over it, nay ſome perform their Devotions at it; One time, ſaith my Author, my Brother and I, and a <hi>Dutch</hi> Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon were going along a narrow way, having the Pales of a Garden on one hand, and a River on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, behind the Pales one of theſe Raſcaly <hi>Bantamers</hi> had hid himſelf, and thruſt his Pike between the Pales thniking to have ſtab'd it into one of our Breaſts, the <hi>Dutch</hi> man being ſomewhat before, the head of the Pike ran into his Breeches, whereupon we both laid hold on the Staff, but my Brother being next the Pales preſently leap'd over and ran the <hi>Faquir</hi> through; Whereupon
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44690:109"/>ſeveral <hi>Chineſes</hi> and other Idolaters came and gave my Brother thanks for killing him; After which we waited on the King, and told him what my Brother had done, who was ſo far from being diſpleaſed that he gave him a Girdle, for the King and his Governours are glad when thoſe Rogues are ſlain, counting them Deſperados, and not fit to live.</p>
               <p>In 1682. The Eldeſt Son of the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> made an Inſurrection, declared himſelf King, and by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the <hi>Dutch</hi> took the City of <hi>Bantam</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory there, proclaiming the old King his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Rebel againſt him. About the ſame time an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador came from the old King to his late Majeſty King <hi>Charles the ſecond of Bleſſed Memory,</hi> by whom he was received and entertained with all manner of kindneſs and civility, and having continued here for ſome time he returned again to his own Countrey.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Socodona</hi> and <hi>Beniermaſa</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Borneo</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſetled other Factories; It is accounted as big as <hi>Spain,</hi> richly incompaſſed with other ſmaller Iſlands, and hath a City of the ſame name founded on Piles in the Salt Water, with Sumptuous buildings of Stone covered with Coco leaves. The people are generally more white than the reſt of the <hi>Indians,</hi> of good Wits and approved Integrity, divided betwixt two Kings and two Religions, the King of <hi>Borneo</hi> and his Wife being <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Laus</hi> ſtill remaining in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Genteliſm; Theſe believe the Sun and Moon are Man and Wife, and the Stars their Children, aſcribing to each of them Divine Honours, and to the Sun eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, whom they ſalute at his firſt riſing with great reverence, repeating certain verſes; Their publick buſineſs is uſually treated in the Night at which time the Councellors of State meet and aſcend ſome Tree, viewing the Heavens till the Moon riſe, &amp; then go to the Senate houſe Their Apparel is very thin by reaſon of the extream heat of the Air, being only a Shirt of Silk or Calico which they wear more for modeſty than warmth.</p>
               <p>One of the Iſles of <hi>Celebs</hi> is called <hi>Macaſſar</hi> where the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44690:110"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi> likewiſe ſetled a Factory, being 600 miles from Eaſt to Weſt, plentiful of all neceſſaries for the uſe of man, in ſome parts over-grown with Wood, in which certain fiery Flyes make nightly ſuch ſhining light as if every Twig or Bough were a burning Candel, in the midſt are very high Mountains, out of which flow many Navigable Rivers. The Iſlanders have a Cuſtom to Poyſon their Arrows, and the moſt dangerous Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they uſe is the juice of certain Trees in the Iſland of <hi>Borneo,</hi> which they will temper ſo as to work a ſwift or ſlow death at pleaſure. They think the King has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſecret Receit to take away the force of it, who boaſts that he has the moſt effectual Poyſon in the World, which there is no Remedy can prevent. One time an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in heat of Blood had killed one of the King of <hi>Macaſſers</hi> Subjects, and though the King had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him, yet both <hi>Engliſh, Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> fearing if the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſhould go unpuniſhed the <hi>Iſlanders</hi> would revenge it upon ſome of them, beſought the King to put him to death, which with much ado being granted, the King unwilling to put him to a lingting death, and deſirous to ſhew the effect of his Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſolved to diſpatch the Criminal himſelf, whereupon he took a long Trunk, and ſhot him exactly in the great Toe of the right Foot, the place he particularly aimed at; Two Chirurgeons one an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> the other an <hi>Hollander</hi> provided on purpoſe, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cut off his Toe, but for all that the Poyſon had diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it ſelf ſo ſpeedily that the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> died preſently; All the Kings and Princes of the Eaſt are very diligent in inquiring after ſtrong Poyſons, and ſome <hi>Europeans</hi> having tryed ſeveral of their Arrows by ſhooting at Squirrels, obſerved they fell down dead as ſoon as they were touched.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principal Acquiſitions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote parts of the World, little or nothing more being to be ſaid of the reſt which are not very conſiderable, and ſome of them ſince quitted by the Honourable <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company; Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compleated my uſual ſcantling, I ſhall here conclude.</p>
